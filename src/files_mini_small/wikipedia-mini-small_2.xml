It is felt that the article you created at [[Ethan cavett]] is not suitable for a Wikipedia article, which must have a [[Wikipedia:Notability|notable]] subject and be [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verifiable]]. I have moved it to [[User:{{PAGENAME}}]], which is where users are free to write about themselves. You are at liberty to move it back into the (Main) namespace but bear in mind that if you do so, it is likely to be nominated for deletion. 

Note, however, that the purpose of a user page is to enable active editors of Wikipedia to introduce themselves to other editors. [[WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_a_blog.2C_webspace_provider.2C_or_social_networking_site|Wikipedia is not a general hosting service]], so your user page is not a personal homepage. Content unrelated to Wikipedia or its editing is likely to be removed.

Please see [[WP:User_page|the user page guidelines]], especially [[WP:User_page#What_can_I_not_have_on_my_user_page.3F|this section]] for more information. -- [[User:Omicronpersei8|Omicronpersei8]] ([[User talk:Omicronpersei8|talk]]) 19:36, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

'''Archer''' is a [[slab serif]] typeface designed in 2001 by [[Tobias Frere-Jones]] and [[Jonathan Hoefler]] for use in ''[[Martha Stewart Living]]'' magazine. It was later released by [[Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones]] for commercial licensing.

==Structure==

The typeface is a [[Slab_serif#Geometric_model|geometric]] slab serif, one with a geometric design similar to sans-serif fonts. It takes inspiration from mid-twentieth century designs such as [[Rockwell (typeface)|Rockwell]].

The face is unique for combining the geometric structure of twentieth-century European slab-serifs but imbuing the face with a domestic, less strident tone of voice. [[Ball terminal|Balls]] were added to the upper terminals on letters such as ''C'' and ''G'' to increase its charm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Devroye|first1=Luc|title=Jonathan Hoefler|url=http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-27370.html|publisher=McGill University|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Italic type|Italics]] are true italic designs, with flourishes influenced by calligraphy, an unusual feature for geometric slab serif designs. As with many [[Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones]] designs, it was released in a wide range of weights from hairline to bold, reflecting its design goal as a typeface for complex magazines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Typographica review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Earls|first1=David John|title=Archer|url=http://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/archer/|website=Typographica|accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
The typeface has been used for, among other things, branding for [[Wells Fargo]] and is a main font for the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' and [[Wes Anderson]]'s film ''[[The Grand Budapest Hotel]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=Lauren|title=Is Archer's Use on Target?|url=http://www.aiga.org/is-archers-use-on-target/|publisher=AIGI}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the current font used for titles and body text by the [[Design Observer]] website.

===[[Katisha]]===
Contains no information not in [[The Mikado]] article, the point of the spin-off unclear, as the character only appears in one opera, and it's unclear how this could expand further. In normal circumstances I'd say merge or make it a redirect, but, as I said, everything IS covered in [[The Mikado]], and I can't imagine someone searching for &quot;Katisha&quot;.

A tag has been placed on [[:Nonamaker]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article seems to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable [[Wikipedia:Notability|(see the guidelines for notability here)]]. If you can indicate why the subject of this article is notable, you may contest the tagging. To do this, please affix the template &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; to the page and leave a note on [[Talk:Nonamaker|the article's talk page]] explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself.

Please read the [[WP:CSD|criteria for speedy deletion]] (specifically, article #7) and [[Wikipedia:Notability (people)|our general biography criteria]].

== Waterboarding ==

Could you post a link where somebody calls [[surfing]] [[waterboarding]]?  I can't seem to find any. [[User:Jehochman|Jehochman]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Jehochman|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:46, 26 April 2009 (UTC)

Yes, Waterboarding is a very common term in Hawaii, the Western US, Australia and even some former Soviet countries. Here's a link to an article where the author references this http://mydailyclarity.com/2009/03/surfing-for-peace-in-the-gaza/. Also, I found a site that references waterboarding here http://www.hawaiiansouthshore.com/shop/product.php?productid=17375. It get's confusing; I was looking for 'surfing' but we call it Waterboarding so I got to the wrong page ;-)

: Fair enough.  That source uses &quot;water boarding&quot; with a space.  I've made a change to your edit to reflect the space. [[User:Jehochman|Jehochman]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Jehochman|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:23, 26 April 2009 (UTC)</text>

I removed &quot;2006 is only his second full season as a team-manager. It took other team managers, such as [[Frank Williams]] many years to win a grand prix as manager.&quot;

This suggests Fry is responsible for a dramatic turnaround in the team's performance - their 2005 and 2006 performances have been widely acknowledged to have been poor to middling. the circumstances of the Hungarian GP were also exceptional. [[User:Mark83|Mark83]] 19:37, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

::It has been reported in the Telegraph (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/motorsport/formulaone/5369856/Monaco-Grand-Prix-Jenson-Buttons-playboy-days-behind-him.html) that Nick Fry owns a proportion of the team, and in an earlier article, that he owns the majority stake. Shouldn't this be added?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/92.239.225.23|92.239.225.23]] ([[User talk:92.239.225.23|talk]]) 23:17, 28 May 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Klein-Glienicke Schweizerhaus 1.jpg|thumb|320px|''Schweizerhaus'' in [[Klein Glienicke]] near [[Berlin]], designed by [[Ferdinand von Arnim]], 1867]]
'''Swiss chalet style''' ({{lang-de|Schweizerstil}}, {{lang-no|Sveitserstil}}) is an [[architectural style]] of [[Historicism (art)|Late Historicism]], originally inspired by rural [[chalet]]s in [[Switzerland]] and the [[Alps|Alpine]] (mountainous) regions of [[Central Europe]]. The style refers to traditional building designs characterised by widely projecting roofs and facades richly decorated with wooden balconies and carved ornaments. It spread over [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Austria-Hungary]] and [[Scandinavia]] during the ''[[Belle Époque]]'' era.

==History==
[[File:Villa Fridheim, Krøderen, 2.jpg|thumb|Villa Fridheim in [[Krødsherad]], Norway]]
Swiss chalet style originated in the [[German Romanticism|Romantic]] era of the late-18th/early-19th century, when the ideas of the [[English landscape garden]] inspired parks and residences in Germany, such as the [[Dessau-Wörlitz Garden Realm]]. It became highly appreciated on the continent by noble landowners who were impressed by the &quot;simple life&quot; of people living in the mountains. 

The chalet style soon spread over the German ''[[Mittelgebirge]]'' landscapes such as the [[Harz]] mountains or the [[Dresden]] area and the adjacent [[North Bohemia]]n region. As a &quot;modern&quot; building style, it also influenced the [[resort architecture]] along the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] seaside, like in [[Binz]] or [[Heringsdorf, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|Heringsdorf]]. Around 1900, design elements were used in the construction of numerous bourgeois family homes as well as by notable architects like [[Heinrich von Ferstel]] to build larger mansions and hotels. 

The style was further popularized by the first waves of tourism of rich people from the North and West of Europe and became popular in other parts of Europe and North America, notably in the [[architecture of Norway]], [[architecture of Iceland|Iceland]] and [[Architecture of the Netherlands|the Netherlands]] and in the [[country house]] architecture of [[architecture of Sweden|Sweden]] and [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati (Ohio, USA)]], in the late 19th and early 20th century. English examples of the chalet style include the [[Boathouse at Belton House]], [[Lincolnshire]], by [[Anthony Salvin]] and the Swiss Cottage at [[Osbourne House]], on the [[Isle of Wight]], constructed for [[Queen Victoria]]'s children.

==Characteristics==
The style is characterized by:
*[[Gabled roof|Gabled roofs]] with wide [[eaves]]
*Exposed construction beams, including large [[Bracket (architecture)|brackets]]
*Decorative carving and mouldings
*[[Balconies]]
*Large windows
*[[Weatherboarding]], usually painted, often in bright colors

The result was '''delete'''. -- [[User:Jitse Niesen|Jitse Niesen]] ([[User talk:Jitse Niesen|talk]]) 12:28, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

:In case anybody requires an explanation how I arrived at this decision, as it is a bit borderline: There seems to be only one reliable source, an article repeated in USA Today and other media. What tipped the balance is firstly the weak reasons in some of the &quot;keep&quot; comments (specifically, those of necronudist, Portillo, and I don't understand Minfo); and secondly, I think we should be extremely cautious in having articles about living children. -- [[User:Jitse Niesen|Jitse Niesen]] ([[User talk:Jitse Niesen|talk]]) 12:45, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

* '''Delete''' - he's ten years old, for crying out loud. If he makes it as a pro then add him in but not until then. [[User:Qwghlm|Qwghlm]] 20:09, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
**'''Comment''' You can't delete or not delete an article purely based on age. --[[User:Pinkkeith|Pinkkeith]] 20:11, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
***'''Comment''' - the point is that he doesn't meet [[WP:BIO]]. There are thousands of kids with potential; they get articles here when that potential is realised by playing for the first team of a significant club. WP is not a crystal ball. [[User:BlueValour|BlueValour]] 20:53, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
****'''Comment''' Well, that wasn't the point that you made, but it does pass [[WP:BIO]] based on [[WP:GOOGLE]]. There is no crystal ball to this article at all, it is all based on present information and known fact. --[[User:Pinkkeith|Pinkkeith]] 21:00, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
*****'''Comment''' What &quot;known fact?&quot;  There is not a single source cited in the entire article.  I am particularly leery of this becoming another AFD where the article is kept because of references cited in the AFD discussion that never make it into the article thus defeating the entire purpose of this discussion and [[WP:V]].  --[[User:ElKevbo|ElKevbo]] 14:26, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
*We can, however, '''delete''' an article if no reliable sources are provided when challenged under [[WP:V|verifiability policy]].  Pinkkeith, can you point us to featured coverage in mainstream media?  Some of those are needed to let us keep the article.  Being signed to a youth team isn't notable enough to get thousands of other kids their own WP articles.  [[User:Barno|Barno]] 20:39, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
** Here is a [http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/technology/maney/2005-02-01-maney_x.htm USA Today article] on him. In there the writer mentions that he was covered in numerous other newspapers. --[[User:Pinkkeith|Pinkkeith]] 20:43, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
*** - fine but he has achieved nothing in the adult world - the press references are the result of a splendid publicity campaign for his video but that doesn't confer notability. [[User:BlueValour|BlueValour]] 20:57, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
**** That's blatent [[ephebiphobia]]. Reread the article, the entire article is talking about the video and how it made him notable. --[[User:Pinkkeith|Pinkkeith]] 21:01, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

[http://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=%22Jean+Carlos+Chera%22&amp;btnG=Search+Archives&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8 Google News Archive] search yields 74 unique hits- more than enough to qualify as &quot;the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person.&quot; How old the subject is and the method in which he was made notable isn't relevant; the subject meets [[WP:BIO]]. --[[User talk:Rory096|Rory096]] 21:14, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
:*'''Comment''' - most of the content, apart from his birthdate, fails [[WP:V]]. The Ghits mean we can keep the article not that we must. They are all the result of a single video being published on the internet and they have all picked up the same story.

[[User:BlueValour|BlueValour]] 16:58, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''-So he's a child prodigy, that doesn't make him notable.  Some of my friends are amazing at basketball, but they don't have any articles.  As above, if he makes it to the pros (or college, if Brazil has a college league, I dunno), then we can always repost.

*'''Delete'''  When he has played for Manchester United, Arsenal, Porto, Eindhoven or Real Madrid he will have earned his article.  Until then it is worth remembering that, at least in the UK, it would be highly improper for professional clubs to express an interest in a 10 year old, let alone to 'openly court' them.

*'''Delete''' I've reviewed some of these news articles. I can read only the English ones, which are basically the same novelty one-shot story, repeated, or something like the USA today story, which is more about how everyone is famous on the Internet than a biographical source for an article.

Many of the users are very bias against the idea of a 7yr old having its own article or the fact that his only a child prodigy, but indeed we have a child prodigy article. Im definately getting a sense of outright bias and a feeling that many of the voters here are americans. [[portillo]]

He is however notable as an internet/media phenomenon. Wikipedia has plenty of articles for such people, as an example go look at [[Mahir Çağrı]]. Then at the bottom of his page have a look at the categories he's placed in.

*'''Delete''' - I wonder if there is a misunderstanding here? If you are a child prodigy as a piano player you can play the piano. If you are a child prodigy as a mathematician you can do complicated sums in your head. Here, the kid undoubtedly has unusual ball skills but that doesn't make him a footballer. I also don't see him as a 'internet/media phenomenon' with any longevity - with YouTube such phenonima come and go like snow in the sun. [[User:TerriersFan|TerriersFan]] 00:01, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
:He was born as a YouTube phenomen but now he's known by all of the users above, has google entries and BBC articles. Guys, you wanna delete him, let's do it. Simply there are people who search for him and people who know him, there are many articles on paper magazines about him, but if you are too zealous to keep a 9-years-old top-youngster 'cause &quot;well, dear Watson, it fails WP:BIO =_= ahem&quot; let's do it.

The '''European Federation of [[Financial Analyst]]s Societies''' ('''EFFAS''')[http://www.effas.com] is the federation of [[financial analyst|analysts]] associations in Europe. EFFAS comprises 27 member societies representing more than 14,000 investment professionals. EFFAS was founded in 1962 and the headquarters is located in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]].

Besides its European training programme CEFA (Certified European Financial Analyst) EFFAS also grants the Certified International Investment Analysts (CIIA) designation, ensuring professional qualification by offering global as well as local market knowledge within its examination structure. As a global designation the exams can be taken in different languages. Through the national member societies EFFAS provides a full range of services for capital market experts.

==CIIA Certification==
EFFAS participates in further developing the [[Certified International Investment Analyst]] (CIIA) examinations, a financial analyst designation recognised globally. Analysts who belong to European analyst associations that are members of EFFAS, are eligible to participate in the final CIIA examination, if they pass the foundation and the national exams, or if they hold the Certified European Financial Analyst diploma (CEFA).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Big Andy, (Andrew Walsh) was born in Louisville, Ky., on Feb. 12, 1978.  His father, Frank Walsh and mother, Marsha Sils were overly delighted to have him, since their first son, Patrick, was a dud.  Big Andy was known through his childhood as being pretty funny.  His brother, not so much.  His parents divorced in 1981, after his father recuperated from emergency brain surgery, after falling through the roof at his work and landing head first on the concrete below.  He continued to work there until he passed away after a 3 year battle with melanoma, in 2006, a week before his 54th birthday.

{{Wikipedia subcat guideline|notability criteria|{{PAGENAME}}|[[WP:NMS]]&lt;br&gt;[[WP:SCIENCE]]}}
--&gt;
{{rejected}}

Ideas related to science are an important part of any comprehensive [[WP:ENC|encyclopedia]].  This guideline and its criteria are intended for use in determining whether a topic is notable due to being a part of or related to science.  The tests in this guideline are intended to be fairly rigirous so that a topic that is acceptable under this guideline can be considered an appropriate part of Wikipedia.  However, the failure of a topic to meet this guideline's criteria does not automatically exclude it, as it may attain notability through [[WP:N]] itself or another of its subsidiary guidelines.

==Notability of topics related to science==

The need for this guideline comes from there being a set of topics which do not fail the test of the [[Wikipedia:No original research|No original research]] policy or the [[Wikipedia:Attribution]] policy but which none the less are not appropriate to Wikipedia because they do have sufficient notability.  Such topics mostly represent new findings and theories, as well as past findings and theories that have failed to gain significant attention in either scientific circles or the public at large (or so far failed to gain said attention).

A key element to understanding this guideline is that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a research publication, and as such Wikipedia does not usurp the usual validation processes of scientific institutions such as [[peer review]], [[scientific consensus]], and academic recognition. Decisions about including or excluding material must always reflect the opinions of outside authorities, not those of Wikipedia editors. Inclusion or exclusion is therefore not a judgement on the validity, importance or accuracy of a scientific contribution, but simply a reflection of the quality and quantity of responses it received inside and outside the [[scientific community]].

This [[WP:N|notability guideline]] derives its relevance from the policies [[WP:NOT|What Wikipedia is not]] (in particular [[WP:NOT#IINFO|Not an indiscriminate collection of information]] and [[WP:NOT#CRYSTALBALL|Not a crystal ball]]), [[WP:NOR|No original research]] and [[WP:NPOV|Neutral point of view]] (in particular [[WP:NPOV#Undue weight|Undue weight]] and [[Wikipedia:Neutral point  of view/FAQ#Pseudoscience|Pseudoscience]]), as well as the guidelines [[Wikipedia:Conflict of interest|Conflict of interest]] and [[WP:AUTO|Autobiography]]. Also of importance are [[WP:V|verifiability]] and [[WP:RS|reliability]] policies.

==Criteria==
=== General ===
In general, a contribution in the field of science is notable enough to merit inclusion in Wikipedia if it meets at least one of the following criteria:

#'''Textbook science.''' There is regular non-incidental mention of the contribution in general or specialized textbooks published by reputable presses.{{ref|1|1}}
#'''Widely cited.''' Papers covering the contribution have been widely cited{{ref|2|2}} in its research field{{ref|3|3}} relative to other papers in the same area. Self-citations, and citations in journals which are not respected within the relevant research field should be excluded.
#'''Press and fiction.''' It is or was well known due to extensive press coverage, or due to being a recurrent theme in notable works of [[fiction]]. In this case the article should make note of this status. A single article on the theory, even if from a major media source such as ''[[New Scientist]]'' or ''[[Scientific American]]'', is not a sufficient criterion.
#'''Historical interest.''' It has historically met any of the above criteria within the scientific community or the culture at large but has since either been [[superseded scientific theory|superseded]], disregarded, or dismissed by the scientific community or the culture at large. The article should make note of the subject's status in this regard.
#'''Popular belief.''' It is or was believed to be true by a significant part of the general population, even if rejected by scientific authorities.

Notable topics which are primarily non-scientific in nature but which contain claims concerning scientific phenomena, should not be handled as scientific.  For example, the ''[[Book of Genesis]]'' itself is primarily covered as a religious scripture rather than as a cosmology. On the other hand, subjects such as [[creationism]] or [[creation science]], which involve a direct conflict between scientific and religious doctrine, are properly evaluated both on a scientific and theological basis. Similarly, subjects purporting to have a scientific basis may be noteworthy primarily on cultural or sociological bases, such as UFOs, which can usefully be discussed from several different perspectives.

:{{Seealso|Wikipedia:Notability (science)/Irrelevant arguments}}

===Scientific terms===
:''See also [[Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms]]
A scientific term is considered notable and worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia if the following can be established:
# A commonly agreed-upon formal or informal definition
# A trajectory of use for the term in the scientific literature from [[WP:RS|reliable]] and [[WP:V|verifiable]] sources
To determine notability it is important to keep in mind that different fields sometimes use the same term to describe different concepts. On the other hand, especially in the early stages of a field, terminology is often not standardized and different terms are used for the same concept. The policy on [[WP:NAME|naming conventions]] gives more information on the choice of the proper term when more than one term is used in the scientific literature.

== Assessing the reliability and relevance of sources ==

Journals from which citations and evidence of notability are obtained are expected to be well known and respected within the relevant research field.  The previous requirement of citation from a peer-reviewed source is not alone sufficient by this requirement.  (Peer review is done just as easily by a fringe science journal as by a leading journal, while [[Nature (journal)|Nature magazine]], one of the most respected [[scientific journals]] in existence, uses editorial as well as  peer review for submissions.)

Textbooks should either be well-known and respected or produced by a reputable scientific publisher (which is most likely the same publisher as one or more respected journals).

Journals from scientific societies of developing countries are occasionally not reliable.  If a finding in such a journal should prove to be of great scientific interest, that finding is often reprinted and/or reported in reliable scientific sources.  In such a case, the original journal article can be cited as a primary source, but its relevance should be backed up by secondary citations in known reliable sources.

For biographical articles and articles on fringe science, there is some loosening of these requirements.  Works by the topic of a biographical article are relevant to the article whether their writing was published in a reliable journal/publisher or not.  Also, the contents of a journal devoted to a fringe science can provide evidence as to the past or current thinking within that fringe field.  However, the fringe science journals cannot provide evidence for the outright notability of the topic.

==Notes==
{{note|1|Note 1}}:  The scientific contribution must have a major entry in the work. A passing mention of the concept is not sufficient. 

{{note|2|Note 2}}:  Citation counts and peer review mechanisms differ vastly between sciences, fields, and subfields, and editors are urged to inform the relevant [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Council/Directory/Science|WikiProject]] about ongoing debates to get expert input. It should also be noted that ''quantity'' of citations is often only a poor approximation of ''quality''.

{{note|3|Note 3}}:  A &quot;research field&quot; indicates an established area of study for which the topic in question is only a part.  A topic cannot be its own research field, nor can it gain notability from being part of a field which is non-notable.

__NOTOC__
===Overview===
After much deliberation of the [[Wikipedia:Danny's contest/Contest entries|contest entries]] the judges have arrived at a decision.

The entries could be broken down into three broad groups... entries that didn't seem to have much, if any, improvement, entries that were a &quot;good try&quot; and a handful of entries that really took the contest to heart and added a lot of interesting and germane references.

===Criteria===
The judges graded on 4 major criteria:
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!Criterion
!Description
!Weight
|-
|'''Number of citations'''
|Just a  raw count of how many were added. This was a good filter to see if the article could make the finalists... only 2 or 3 refs suggested that maybe not so much had been done.  
|(20%)
|-
|'''Complexity of citations'''
|A gauge of the difficulty level of adding them. Were they notes? web cites? book cites? did they use ISBN tagging? were there multiple places that got the same note? Notes ON notes? 
|(30%)
|-
|'''Appropriateness of cites'''
|Were they actually GOOD cites that moved the article forward?
|(20%)  
|-
|'''Overall article improvement'''
|How much was the article helped (expanded, quality increased, made more pleasing to the eye) by cites added? 
|(30%)
|}

===Finalists===
The three most impressive articles were as follows... ANY of them could easily be FA candidates shortly.

|'''[[Battle of Ceresole]]'''
|An important battle in medieval history, part of the [[Italian Wars]] series. Characterised by contemporaries as &quot;marvellously confused&quot; this battle is attractively illustrated with lots of maps and diagrams. One would expect Kyrill as coordinator of [[WP:MILHIST]] to do a good job of improving an article, and Kyrill does not disappoint. A very powerful article about an interesting battle.

|'''[[Theramenes]]'''
|An important general and historical figure of ancient Greece, including participating in an Athenian coup, multiple battles, and a rebellion. He even had notoriety after death. The article is challenging due to a paucity of sources, but Robth found 80+ cites. There also is an innovative organisation of sources into modern and ancient. A very good article based on some painstaking research.

|'''[[Crawford expedition]]'''
|A very understudied but important battle in the [[American Revolution]]. The winning side often tends to ignore battles they lost, and this article was not much more than a single paragraph stub when Kevin went to town on it. It is now profusely illustrated with maps, paintings, tables and diagrams and has grown to 43 Kb. In addition to 88 high quality footnotes, it also has a comprehensive &quot;references&quot; and &quot;for further reading&quot; section, properly separated out. All books have good ISBN links. This article is a real tour de force and shows the power of our encyclopedia well.

'''Joe Eubanks''' (born 1975) is an [[United States|American]] [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] best known by the [[ring name]] '''Lobo'''. He wrestled primarily in [[Combat Zone Wrestling]] (CZW), where he won every major championship and was the first inductee into the [[CZW Hall of Fame]] in 2004. He was formerly the CZW Commissioner/Talent Coordinator.&lt;ref name=&quot;Online World of Wrestling&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/040207.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling 5th Anniversary Show February 7, 2004 - Philadelphia, Pennsylvania - ECW Arena|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===1999-2002===
Along with [[Nick Gage]], [[Justice Pain]], and [[Ric Blade]], Lobo was trained by [[John Zandig]] at the CZW Wrestling School and graduated first in the class.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freewebs.com/andy_czw1/history.html CZWHookup : The history of CZW] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210134119/http://www.freewebs.com/andy_czw1/history.html |date=2008-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He became one of the main wrestlers in CZW along with other graduates from the school. In February 1999, Lobo became the second [[CZW Iron Man Championship|Iron Man Champion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Online World of Wrestling&quot;/&gt; He held the title until June when he lost it to Justice Pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/990619.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling - CZW Down in Flames June 19, 1999 - Mantua, NJ |accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two continued wrestling each other and competed in the first ever Cage of Death match at the first ''Cage of Death'' show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/991016.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling - CZW Cage of Death October 16, 1999 - Mantua, NJ|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lobo won the match and regained the title. He would lose this title to [[Matt Prince|Wifebeater]], but regain it one more time the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/000311.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling - CZW March Violence March 11, 2000 - Sewell, NJ|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lobo also challenged for the [[CZW World Heavyweight Championship|CZW Heavyweight Championship]]. He feuded with Zandig for the title and finally beat him in July 2000. He held the title until ''Cage of Death II''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/000909.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling - CZW Cage of Death II....After Dark September 9, 2000 - Sewell, NJ|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that show, Lobo successfully defended the championship against Zandig in the Cage of Death match. Directly following this match, Justice Pain came out and fought Lobo in another Cage of Death match. In the match, Lobo was thrown from the top of the cage to the ground through a table covered in barbed wire. Justice Pain went on to win the match and the title.&lt;ref name=&quot;Online World of Wrestling&quot;/&gt;  After losing the title, Lobo continued feuding with Zandig. This time, the feud was for ownership of CZW. On February 9, 2002, Lobo defeated Zandig to become the new owner of CZW. He held this position until ''Cage of Death IV'' when Zandig defeated him to regain his position as CZW's owner &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/021213.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling December 13, 2002 - Philadelphia, PA - Viking Hall|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2003-present===
He took some time off from CZW following the Cage of Death match. While he was gone, a new group called the Hi-V tried to take over CZW, with Zandig as their main target. Zandig was planning to face the Hi-V at ''Cage of Death V'', but the stable outnumbered his team 6 to 4. At ''Night of Infamy II'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/031115.html|title=Night of Infamy II - November 15, 2003 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lobo made a shocking return to help Zandig and join his team just in time for Cage of Death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/031213.html|title=Cage of Death V December 13, 2003 - Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their team was successful. In February 2004, Lobo became the first inductee to the CZW Hall of Fame. After this, Lobo remained inactive for the following two years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Online World of Wrestling&quot;/&gt;

At [[Cage of Death 7]], [[Zandig]], who had turned on the fans, wanted to run CZW the way they used to. He called out Lobo, who was backstage for the event, and they joined each other along with [[Justice Pain]] and [[Nick Gage]]. They would later call themselves the Forefathers of CZW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/_2006/|title=2006 results

The article's [[User:Kobius|prime editor]] (and incidentally, the forum admin) removed the AfD tag from the page and does not take kindly to other editors touching 'his' page.  The whole layout of the article is clearly trying to draw viewers into the forums, perhaps to meet the admitted goal of 500,000 posts.  Add these to the issues others have pointed out and there's really no need for further discussion.

I think it should stay because just like the gamefaqs article and the ebay one it helps people understand a site more. The Anizone is a large site and I think if someone wants to find out more about it they come to the best internet dictionary in the world and they research on of the largest best sites. The site has a largely amount of fair people considering it has been hacked three times. The admin accidently remoe it thinking it would be delete and he was not the maker of the page but it was I.

==BBC News Report and the pilot &quot;looking for a good place to crash&quot;==

The BBC article states that the pilot was looking for a good place to put the aircraft down; he missed some park and instead put the aircraft down in an uninhabited area near Stockport city centre. The evidence does not justify this supposition whatsoever. For one thing, the AIB report states that the aircraft was likely uncontrollable after the engines cut out, and might not have been controllable even before then. The first officer died and the captain suffered retrograde amnesia, so we don't know what went on in the cockpit. There isn't the tiniest shred of evidence that the pilot &quot;put the aircraft down&quot; someplace safe. It was likely just coincidence - there are a lot of empty or disused areas around airports and under approach paths (and *that* is often deliberate).

This is such a common urban legend/media foofah. Every time a plane doesn't actually fall out of the sky, some media type comes up and says the pilot was &quot;looking for a place to crash that wouldn't cause injuries on the ground&quot;. I don't blame the Wikipedian who put this in at all, because he/she likely didn't have any sources other than the BBC article. I am blaming the BBC for making a supposition not supported by the facts.

I suppose people want to think that in an emergency the first thing the pilot will do is look for a safe place to crash. It makes them feel less worried about an aircraft crashing into their home, school, or place of business. It ain't necessarily so, though; in fact it almost is never so. Aircraft about to crash are more often than not uncontrollable - that's why they crash. --[[User:Charlene.fic|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot; face=&quot;Matisse ITC&quot;&gt;Charlene&lt;/font&gt;]] 19:40, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

Edited to add: The cause of the accident wasn't &quot;pump failure&quot; (boo, BBC, again). It was a design error in the fuel line. --[[User:Charlene.fic|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot; face=&quot;Matisse ITC&quot;&gt;Charlene&lt;/font&gt;]] 20:02, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

:Apologies. That would have been my factual faux pas. Thank you for correcting my blathering and making this article respectable. :) [[User:Legion89|Legion]] 13:56, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

A second's more flight and the plane would catastrophically have taken the tower off Stockport's fine Town Hall and crashed into the facade of the (then) infirmary opposite the Town Hall, blocking the main road between that runs from Manchester through Stockport to the south - AG, Stockport.

== Additional cause of this crash ==

I remember seeing a BBC program about this crash. It reported on the findings of the inquiry. It said that there was an additional reason for the crash.

Apparently, the engine speeds were shown in the cockpit on two dials, one for each wing. Each dial had two hands, one for each engine and each labelled with the engine number.

This had been serviced, and a mistake had been made so that engine 3 was connected to the hand marked &quot;4&quot;, and engine 4 to hand &quot;3&quot;.

I think it was engine 4 that was starved of fuel. The pilot saw from the dial that engine 3 had stopped, so he switched off / feathered engine 3. Now both engines on the right wing were out. (This would explain why engine 4 was windmilling.)

As part of the investigation, they tried flying a similar aircraft with engines 3 and 4 both out, and discovered that the aircraft could not be flown properly.

Now, I mention all this because it is an interesting story. Also, because I want to apply the moral to setting up a computer cluster. I want to avoid the possibility of one computer failing and a different one being taken out for service by mistake, thereby bringing down the cluster. 

Does anyone know more about this? [[User:Mm67|Mm67]] 11:44, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

==Is [[Wikipedia:Notability (science)]] a consensus guideline?==
Please state your position, '''yes''' or '''no''', explain your position and defend it.  This is not a vote.  [[User:SmokeyJoe|SmokeyJoe]] 10:47, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Yes''' I consider it one, and I'm not sure what objection people have - if there's a problem that needs fixing, let's fix it.  I already refer to it, guideline or not, since it's very useful.  --[[User:Minderbinder|Minderbinder]] 12:38, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Yes''' Not only is it a consensus guideline, it is absolutely vital for Wikipedia to have such a guideline. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 12:51, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Yes''' I certainly support this guideline, what it is trying to do, and how it is trying to achieve it. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:10, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Yes''' We're ready to go into the stage where changes should be discussed here before being implemented in the policy page. ~ [[User:Trialsanderrors|trialsanderrors]] 17:40, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Absolutely''' We've numerous AfDs and arbcom cases which have documented that this is the community's intent. --[[User:EngineerScotty|EngineerScotty]] 17:44, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* I don't see where the proposed criteria add meaningful advice to writters or evaluators, and the preamble/text is way too long to be practical.  Please cite some examples of AfD where this proposal would have ensured an outcome other than what would have been achieved under the current guidelines.  For each of the criteria now listed I belive that proper application of WP:N and WP:ATT would acheive the same results.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 17:54, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
** There is [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Electric universe (concept)]], where this standard helped to refine the arguments that finally got the topic removed.  The aupporters trying to use this guideline to buoy their cause ended up only showing all the more that the article did not belong in Wikipedia.  &lt;br&gt;You are correct that in the end articles that are removed will be so removed (or not) due to policy concerns.  The need for this guideline comes from its ability to focus the debate on the issues that are important in the relevant cases.  In other words, it helps to achieve the &quot;proper application&quot; that you are claiming makes this guideline irrelevant. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 18:22, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
*** EMS, could your purpose be acheived with an essay?  Among the problems with permutations from guidelines and policies is the evolution into redundant and conficting guidance to the point that writers and evaluators become confused and the branches work at cross purposes.  My frequent analogy is the US Tax Code, which has bread several large industries for interpretation and application.  Writing complex rule sets requires great skill and caution. --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 18:34, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
*** On review of the Electric universe (concept) AfD, it appears to be resoundingly rejected with the tools we already have, most convincingly original research and few reliable sources.  This outcome is consistent with other scientific and academic issues which I have seen defeated at AfD. An excellent nomination doesn't hurt either! --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 18:42, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
**** Right now I am wondering what your agenda is here, as this type of opposition usually comes from someone who has lost an AfD in part due to this and the guidelines and is seeking to water down the standards.  One of the factors that helped with the electric universe AfD was the the nominator was also working on this guideline and used its insights in writing the nom.  Beyond that, there is the basic issue of moving beyond &quot;peer review&quot; as a standard for inclusion, a test passed by numerous non-notable articles that I have seen.  Also, I at least have gone to some pains to couch this as a setting standard for inclusions instead of exclusion.  That way, an argument that &quot;X calls for inclusion&quot; renders this guideline moot as a refutation, and so avoids the types of conflicts that in our laws make being a lawyer such a profitable profession. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 19:16, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
***** My agenda is not as you assert, but your question is a fair one, which I will answer.  My agenda is clarity in the grand scheme of notability guidelines, without a specific prejudice to this proposal. Please visit the discussion page for WP:N to see that there are many people expressing concerns over the whole process.  I support the concept of &quot;encyclopedic suitability&quot;, which we call notablility at WP, for lack of a better name.  I also consider myself a moderate inclusionist.  I am a frequent participant in Afd.  You are correct in one respect, that I origninally became involved in AfD and notability, because I saw too many abuses by uninformed editors who were deleting meanigful articles, though not specifically in the field of science.  My interest is in history and sailing.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 19:33, 16 March 2007 (UTC) 
******Might I recommend that your &quot;no&quot; comment seems to be motivated more by a general dislike for [[WP:N]] rather than a specific distaste for this particular guideline. In particular, the motivation behind this guideline was in part due to a charge made during the [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Pseudoscience|Pseudoscience arbitrartion case]] that such a guideline should exist to fend off charges related to whether an idea was notable in a scientific sense. One can argue whether [[WP:N]] should exist or not, but that's not for us to decide here. It is absolutely not true that this guideline is redudant: there is no other place where it is indicated what makes a scientific idea notable for inclusion in the encyclopedia. [[WP:NOR]] doesn't help because &quot;originality&quot; is a vague concept related to heavily to [[WP:V]] and [[WP:COI]] to be useful when people just make random articles about ostensibly scientific subjects they read about online, for example. [[WP:A]] doesn't help because there are scientific ideas which are not notable (the general consensus of the community is that they do not belong in the encyclopedia) which nevertheless are attributable to reliable sources. [[WP:NPOV]] doesn't work because the exclusion criteria at [[WP:NPOV#Undue weight]] is unable to distinguish between majority and minority except by [[WP:CON|consensus]]. That's why this guideline is needed and why it is used. Look at all the pages that link here and tell me that it isn't referred to. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 13:09, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
* No, it's not.  I think the burden of some evidence that this guideline is widely supported and necessary needs to be shown from the supporters.  Right now it's an initiative, a proposal with stable wording.  However, even in the &quot;test cases&quot; that I looked at, it seems that this guideline isn't being referred to, and evaluation of the articles in question isn't done with these guidelines in mind, rather, articles are mainly evaluated from a point of view of adequate sourcing and original research issues, in other words, policies we already have.  (I do think the editors here have reached a reasonably stable consensus, though.  But that doesn't, to me, make a &quot;consensus guideline,&quot; which implies support from the community overall.)[[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:04, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
**The evidence is in the ''What links here'' tool you can access from the toolbox. I think that you may have a hidden agenda here: you tend to be a bit too quick to agree to a supression bias against non-experts in the fields of science. Is this a misplaced concern? --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 13:09, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
***First of all there are over 150 things that link to [[Wikipedia:Notability (science)]], so it's not unreasonable to expect evidence to be actually gathered by someone trying to make a case.  But more, I went to a few of those &quot;what links here&quot; and apparently the only reason they were linked was that trialsanderrors mentioned that the debate was a test case: not people actually referring to the guideline and trying to use it.  Look at the Electric Universe AfD, for instance, which is the best example I've seen of a borderline-notable scientific theory (where this guideline might help).  [[WP:SCIENCE]] was not used as an argument in the debate, even by you, and the arguments that led to it being deleted were not even much along the lines of what is presented here in the guideline, but were according to core Wikipedia policies like [[WP:ATT]], [[WP:OR]] and so on.  Some of the argument is covered here in the introduction, but the &quot;criteria&quot; part played no role and seems to be central to this as a notability guideline.  So, this is what I mean when I say that no evidence has been presented.  What do YOU mean when you say this is a consensus guideline?  [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:43, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
****The criteria part played a huge role. The only criteria that EU could have come close to satisfying was recognition in popular culture/outside media and we showed that it was not notable along those lines. The guidelines at the time were being formulated and weren't as clear as they are now, but thanks to discussions such as that AfD we have a clearer demarcation. I think you need to read through the AfD we reference again and look carefully at how the criteria line-up with the criteria outlined in this guideline. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:02, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
*****Could you show me precisely where?  I don't mean to be dense, but I really don't see it.  I see your point #5 in the nomination, but that sounds like the core [[WP:N]] argument, and not related to the criteria here.  And anyway, saying the the EU debate influenced [[WP:SCIENCE]] kind of precludes that the EU debate can be thought of as evidence that this is a consensus guideline.  Can you show me ANY AfD debate that explicitly references the criteria?  [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:17, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
******Number 5 in the nomination. While it doesn't explicitly reference this page, it does so implicitly (and if I recall correctly at the time the standards were still being developed as to which criteria were going to be grouped with which). --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:20, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
*******Again, #5 was really along the lines of basic [[WP:N]].  Again, show me any debates that explicitly reference the criteria.  There's a difference between this proposal being wise or balanced or sensible and it having ''broad community support.''  [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:44, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
********Basic [[WP:N]]&quot;? That's a bit of WikiLawyering I haven't come across before. The fact is that #5 has direct parallels to our criteria here. You can thrust your head in the sand over this all you want, but that's the plain truth of the matter. And now you reposition your attack to claim that there isn't &quot;broad community support&quot;, but let me remind you that arbcomm members entreatied the community to develop these standards in the first place and that by virtue of this being a Wiki it will end up as balanced and sensible as possible. I'm beginning to think you are being a stick-in-the-mud for reasons you aren't coming clean about. Help me out, explain to me why you always seem to be fighting against scientific accuracy at Wikipedia so I can [[WP:AGF|assume good faith]] towards your contributions. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 17:36, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
***I suggest you go read [[WP:AGF]] and actually take it to heart.  In our current discussion, you seem to have trouble differentiating between (1) my personal support or opposition of the proposal and (2) my arguing that the proposal isn't a &quot;consensus guideline&quot;, that is, that it doesn't have broad support.  This wouldn't be a very hard difference to understand if you had been assuming good faith of me in the first place.  For the record, I support some of what the proposal says but not all of it, but that wasn't the basis for my objections: calling the proposal a &quot;consensus guideline&quot; is wrong, because this is still a very new proposal, barely even stable enough to judge.  [[WP:PROF]] remained a proposal for a very long time, and finally became a guideline when it became apparent that the guideline had influenced the way decisions were being made, and that the community, de facto, embraced the guideline.  Creation of policies and guidelines is slow and for good reason, especially when actionable changes are being proposed (like the criteria here).  [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:00, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
****I appreciate your candor regarding your opinions of the content of this guideline because that is precisely what concerns me. However, I do feel that you are being a bit oblique in your commentary. &quot;Policy creation is slow,&quot; is often the cry of those who want to slow things down, and people tend to drag their feet for a reason. To me and many of the other editors who commented above, this guideline is ''de facto'' in place and isn't a proposal because we as editors abide by it. As you know, Wikipedia policies and guidelines are not written to affect change in the encyclopedia, but rather are meant to describe what actively goes on in editing. A good number of those who say that this is a consensus guideline edit a lot of science-related articles and so should be the ones to tell whether or not this guideline applies. I don't see that you are actively doing this as such. I do see you stepping into disputes regarding science-related articles often, and there are many times I see these actions as being in something of a contravention of the guidelines outlined here. I am being very up-front about my distrust of your motivations, but in so doing I'm also trying to assume good-faith as much as I can. Part of assuming good-faith is being transparent about one's perceptions and I'm offering you the opportunity to explain yourself as transparently as possible so we can move on. I don't like being lectured about [[WP:AGF]] when I was the one who brought it up, it looks to me like you are asking me to turn a blind eye towards our long history here at the encyclopedia and I am honestly telling you I'm having a hard time doing it because of the nature of this particular dispute we're having. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 13:53, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
*****You are making false implications about me, and I want it to stop.  [[WP:CIV|Comment on my comments]].  You say this is an attempt to document how Wikipedia works?  I respectfully disagree -- this talk page and its archives are full of debates about what the criteria ''should'' be, with very little discussion or analysis of how things are actually decided now.  (Some, but not much.)  From perusing the test cases, it seems to me that people are nearly exclusively deciding on these cases on the basis of [[WP:OR]], [[WP:ATT]], and [[WP:NPOV]], (and to a degree, [[WP:N]]), without much need for arguments specific to issue that the topics under discussion are scientific ones.  Since that ''isn't'' the content of this proposal, I cannot agree that this is documenting current Wikipedia practice, but if you want to try to change my mind, please show me specific examples so we can discuss them.  In any case, you should advertise this debate on [[WP:VPR]]; the general Wikipedia community should have a chance to comment.

******Whether they are false or not, they are simply my questions regarding your, frankly, obstinate resistance to this particular document. I am trying to be as forthright as possible here, and your increasingly haughty responses only confuse me further since you still haven't addressed directly my concerns regarding the history we have surrounding issues such as this. I disagree that the discussions are centering around how things &quot;should&quot; be. Rather I see discussions centering around generalizing from the experience that editors have. You also seem to be under the opinion that just because people reference older and more established policies and guidelines they aren't also considering this guideline. This I find to be particularly problematic because it ignores the words of people that aren't appended with a WP-acronym. Just because somebody doesn't cite this directly doesn't mean that you can't see the criteria being applied (as per our earlier discussion on EU deletion). I would hope that you would look more closely at the deletion discussions surrounding this and see if you can't spot the criteria in action. I am not going to advertise the debate anywhere, but you are free to do so. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 16:27, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
*******I've advertised the debate at [[WP:VPR]].  In terms of the status: you see one thing, I see another thing.  I'm not going to change my opinion by simply being told &quot;please look more closely,&quot; although you could convince me if you actually showed me some evidence.  I do see a lot of attempts at guiding the community: take a look at [[#&quot;Conference topic&quot; is a backdoor]], for instance, or [[#One final thought]]: people are discussing how to make a good rule, not what the rule is, organically.

****  The problem lies less with any individual sub-guideline, but more with a plethora of permutations leading to confusion.

***** I don't see any bedlam here.  I see this as being a well crafted guideline that is dealing with issues which are out-of-scope for the more general guideline due to its broad nature.  This guideline deals with the issues of science and science-related topics, and how to implement the notability guidelines within that context.&lt;br&gt;I have looked at the [[WP:N]] discussion and I get the feeling that you are doing your best to create uncertainty and confusion there.  And now you are trying to do the same here.  I for one have no need for it, and support this guideline as a reflection of the legitimate sense of the science editors here as to what is valid. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 18:23, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
*Yes, this appears to be a consensus guideline. The opposition to this guideline proposal may be part of a campaign in which User:Kevin Murray in the past month has placed &quot;rejected&quot; , &quot;disputed&quot; , or &quot;historical&quot; , or &quot;essay&quot; labels on about a dozen notability proposals or guidelines or has nominated them for deletion on the grounds that there was no consensus or that they constituted &quot;instruction creep&quot; or were redundant. A proposal is not necessarily impossible to reach consensus upon just because a few editors oppose it.

** I see your point.  This editor really, really has a grudge against the concept of notability, and I would love to know why.  If you want to do a [[WP:RfC]] against him, I am will be happy to second it.  This is ridiculous. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 19:42, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
*** No EMS, this editor, has a &quot;grudge&quot; against needless and redundant rule making for the sake of rule making.  I strongly support the concept of encyclopedic suitability which we call &quot;notability&quot; at WP.  This is not &quot;ridiculous&quot; but based on observations from life experience, that too many conficting rules create confusion rather than clarity.  Complex rule-sets require incredible cross coordination among the permutations, which is not happening here at WP, as guidelines are multiplying like rabbits without consideration of the big picture.  If you propose an RfC, please do so in the best interest of WP, not &quot;against&quot; me; this is not personal and reviewing the discussions will reveal that my actions are well supported.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 14:18, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
****There are plenty of Wikipedians who [[WP:IAR|agree with you about hating rules]]. However, might I suggest that you are going about it the wrong way. We are here writing this guideline because we need to summarize what has been done in regards to this issue. Your own personal distaste for the way in which editors have gone about doing this is probably best argued elsewhere: it certainly has nothing to do with whether consensus exists for this particular guideline. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:29, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
*** I do not see '''any''' need to coordinate this guideline with any other guidelines beside [[WP:N]] itself.  Although I am doing my own &quot;[[WP:NOR|original research]]&quot;, I have seem enough -uh- &quot;stuff&quot; offered by others such that I see a need to draw a firm and reasonable as to what is and is not acceptable here.  Until it has some reasonable amount of recognition in the scientific community, I see an article on my ideas as being an abuse of Wikipedia.  Yet I am unusual in that most other editors of Wikipedia with alternate ideas are here to promote those ideas, and they hate guidelines like this one with a purple passion because they help to keep their OR out.&lt;br&gt;BTW - I do see where you have had some success with you anti-Notability campaign.  Personally I think that you are doing Wikipedia a real disservice with it, and what you are stifling is not a bunch useless rule-making but instead needed elaborations on the meaning of Notability in various domains.  As has been noted in [[Wikipedia_talk:Notability|the WP:N discussion]], there is a level of subjectiveness in determining notability.  The need for these subsidary guidelines is to limit that subjectiveness, and thereby make this concept more usable.  Instead you are trying to pull the rug out from under Notability, something that will make the removal of questionable material much more difficult than it should be. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 16:08, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''the real test''' is whether the guidelines here will be accepted in practice. Both the above positions are to some degree correct: the guideline should reflect what its eds. believe to be the common feeling of the community, but it shouldalso point in the direction of where the consensus appears to be moving, and to be making recommendations from those most involved in edited these articles to guide thos less familiar. I think it will prove to be accepted because it is relatively straightforward, not complex -- at least by comparison -- and, in my view it does reflect the general voice. But we shall see. 
::The real dispute , I think, is over the notability of fringe science and whether that can be considered science in any sense at all. This is a matter in which I think there is in fact no real consensus, but at best a temporary majority, and i expect this  question to continue to be the theme of AfDs. I don't think this guideline  lays it to rest '''[[User:DGG|DGG]]''' 23:36, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
::: This guideline cannot and should not judge whether something is &quot;real science&quot;.  In fact, all that a determination that something is &quot;not science&quot; can do here is to remove a topic from being judged by this criteria with no resolution on its notability or lack thereof.  IMO, we have a set of criteria here such that anything that is meant to be judged as part of science can be ruled on here, be it mainstream or fringe.  What I think that you will find is that the least palatable topics are those which also have had the least impact and are also therefore the least notable.  --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 01:53, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

== Some suggestions on organizing this project page ==

* The introduction is too long.  Limit it to &quot;what&quot; and &quot;why&quot;.  Get the commentary (i.e. &quot;impetus&quot;) and discussion of process into its own section.  Specifically address what makes ''science'' different from other areas covered by the general guidelines.
* Criteria should define at least these categories as guidance to editors:
** topics which on their face should be include (i.e. the notable)
** topics which are going to require some judgments to be made by editors if they are new articles or added to existing articles. (i.e. the maybe notable)
** topics which, at least according to the authors of the guideline, are ''improbably'' included. (i.e. nonnotable)
* The statement ''&quot;Decisions about including or excluding material must always reflect the opinions of outside authorities, not those of Wikipedia editors.&quot;'' is bizarre because the opinion of Wikipedia editors is what, by definition, compose the Wikipedia. ''&quot;Must always&quot;'' is a rather strange term to be found in a mere ''guideline'' at any rate. [[User:Patsw|patsw]] 13:22, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

:: If you wish to draft an alternate version, the feel free to do so ''elsewhere'' and present it to us as a possible replacement.  We are certainly amenable to productive changes.  However, IMO the current project page works and should be considered a functioning guideline. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:13, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
:I agree the ''reflect outside authorities'' wording is odd (although not any odder than &quot;notability is not subjective&quot; which expresses the [[WP:ATT|same sentiment]]). The rest doesn't strike me as an improvement. ~ [[User:Trialsanderrors|trialsanderrors]] 17:49, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

::One point that isn't being made (in the intro) and probably should be is the point that scientific theories cannot be properly presented without understanding their level of acceptance.  There's a big difference between a mainstream theory and a fringe theory, and even in an article about a fringe theory, it's important to describe it as one.  However, for some fringe theories, insufficient sources exist to back up the claim that they are fringe theories.  Thus we are left with only one real choice: disallow the article, as we cannot properly cover it while adhering to [[WP:ATT]] and [[WP:NPOV]].  This is different from, say, an article about a band, where it may be that no source reports on their popularity or number of fans accurately, but sources do report on other things: the information we can't cover can just be left out.  In articles on science, we really can't leave that out.  [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:41, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

:::The &quot;level of acceptance&quot; argument makes no sense to me. &quot;Theory&quot; in science has a very precise meaning which applies to models and descriptions which are as completely accepted as possible in an endeavor based primarily on the dubious activity of inductive reasoning. While there is a big difference between mainstream and fringe proposals, the proposals themselves are only considered &quot;theories&quot; when they pass the tests of the scientific method. What makes a proposal fringe is, ostensibly, its inability to pass these tests. This doesn't mean that scientists don't make mistakes in pejoratively labeling the fringe out of the mainstream, only to say that the level of acceptance is something of a binary operator: either it's in or it's out. When an idea does not generate enough interest in the scientific community to create commentary from members of the community, it must either be uncontroversial (as is the case with textbook knowledge) or it must be outside the scientific community. This is quite easy to verify. No amount of posturing and insisting on the part of a fringe idea's proponents that the idea is actually &quot;scientific&quot; is good enough when demarcating for our purposes. We might still have articles on the idea if there is &quot;extra-scientific&quot; interest in it, but we do not need to shy away from being honest about its &quot;extra-scientific&quot; nature. One of the problems that many pro-fringe editors have is that they believe that because [[negative proof|proving the negative]] is in principle a defiance of [[WP:ATT]] that reasonable editors can't make editorial judgments with regards to the status of a particular idea. This is simply not the case at all: we are editing an encyclopedia not compiling a list of sources. After all, that's why we have editors in the first place: we are charged with summarizing the available data in the most conformist way possible. When all the data is outside the scientific community and the idea purports to have scientific importance, it is perfectly fine to delineate the contradiction. However, this discussion is probably better suited for [[WP:FRINGE]]. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:09, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

*I think it is a little more complicated than that.
*It is not ''necessary'' to give an indication of the acceptance of a theory, in order to describe it.
*And I don't think the word &quot;theory&quot; has such a precise meaning as scientists would like. For example, Wikipedia calls the [[Big Bang]] a &quot;theory&quot;, whereas the Encyclopedia Britannic calls it a &quot;Model&quot;. And I am sure there are more sources supporting both.
*This is why the new [[WP:A]] is so important. I can attribute both the Big Bang Theory, and the Big Bang Model, but I can find no source which agues it must be one or the other.
*I can also find no attribution labelling many minority subjects as &quot;fringe&quot;, nor claiming a certain level of acceptance. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 17:47, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

== Making this an approved guideline ==

I notice that Kevin Murray has downgraded this guideline back to the &quot;proposed&quot; status.  I would revert that myself, except that I am not at all clear by what action/authority it became considered a functioning guideline.  Certainly the above poll has produced only five people who support this as a guideline.  Even without the two nay-sayers I fail to see how the five of us constitute a group that can speak for the Wikipedia community as a whole, or at least the science editors.

I for one do call for the issue of approving this as a functioning guideline be presented to the community as a whole.  [[Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)|the Village Pump policy forum]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Science|WikiProject Science]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Physics|WikiProject Physics]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Chemistry|WikiProject Chemistry]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Biology|WikiProject Biology]] are all places where this guideline can be advertised and input and approval sought.  I see little danger in this and much promise, but mostly I would like to be able to show Kevin a formal approval so that is downgrading of this guideline cannot occur again. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 02:17, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

::We don't do &quot;formal&quot; and &quot;official&quot; with respect to guidelines. What matters is if this is (1) a good idea and (2) used as such in practice.

Judged by this talk page and AFD, the answer to all three is 'yes', so this page is a de facto guideline and Kevin is the lone dissenter here. Of course, putting a notice on the village pump never hurts.

:::Kevin is not the only dissenter, I also am.  Let me enumerate some general criticisms, this time relating to the substance of the proposal.  1.  There is not a big need for this.  Most science articles up for deletion are up for other concerns than notability, primarily, concerns that the article is original research, POV, or inadequately sourced.  Although there are many debates on the test pages subpage, in very few was the critical issue the notability of the subject: [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Electric universe (concept)]], [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Socionomics]], and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Growing Earth Theory]] (and the old debates, not listed there, about [[Time Cube]]).  2.  The list of criteria, a core part of this proposal, were not used as the basis of successful arguments in any of the key examples I listed.  Rather, the test seems to be the general one of being covered in multiple independent sources, inside or outside of the scientific community.  Note that the criteria give an opportunity to supporters of OR articles (real OR, not neutral attempts at describing published research) to argue for inclusion inappropriately: see [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sorce theory]] as an example of this.  The criteria have changed since then, but the same kind of argument could be made today.  I wouldn't want to jeopardize any of those debates by having a guideline here with such minimal applicability.  3.  The list of criteria is instruction creep and isn't useful.  For articles that should be deleted, not meeting the criteria doesn't make a strong argument.  For articles that should be kept, they're okay, but arguments to delete things that meet these criteria are weak delete arguments in the first place, usually along the lines of &quot;this article is in bad shape&quot;, see [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ubiquitous computing]] for example.  The criteria seem aimed at solving a non-existant problem of the over-deletion of notable science topics.

*The fundamental flaw of [[WP:SCIENCE|Notability (science)]], is that it tries to determine only whether an article is '''scientifically''' notable. It does not consider whether an article may be notable in '''any''' other area. 
*If Wikipedia was a '''Scientific''' encyclopedia, there would be a case to answer. It isn't. Wikipedia has '''not''' adopted a &quot;scientific point of view&quot;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view/FAQ#Pseudoscience]

*: This is a true red herring IMO.  A failure of scientific notability does not mean that an article may have notability in another manner and therefore be worthy of inclusion.  I did have wording here to that effect at one time, but it seems to have been lost.  I will see to restoring that, as I see this guideline as being usable only as a means of inclusion.  For the purposes of exclusion, the failure of a topic to merit inclusion under any guideline (including this one) is the relevant matter. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:27, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

Since popular notability definitely is acceptable (see the [[Time Cube]] precedent, for instance), any wording that implies otherwise should be examined.

:::::::What you fail to realize is that there is an informal community discussion as well as a formal publication discussion. Those who are in a particular community are aware of the informal discussion and are able to tell when a topic is ignored/scoffed or when it is accepted. This cannot be reported at Wikipedia for verifiability reasons, but it still raises NPOV concerns when certain editors try to force obscure research into the forefront of an article. You are mistaking a standard of verifiability (which is the standard for how to write an article) with editorial judgement: they need not be one-in-the-same. In other words, one need not &quot;verify&quot; that there is NPOV issues because, as editors, our editorial opinions do not need to be (nor can they be) verified. The only thing that needs to be verifiable is the text of the article. We are allowed to have judgements that are external to this. As such, it is perfectly reasonable to say that there are NPOV problems with someone citing a single, isolated, though published research paper. In terms of your dark matter red herring, you have totally misconstrued the situation, and I'm fairly confident that nearly any third party not firmly ensconced in pathological skepticism toward mainstream astrophysics would find your evaluation predictably myopic. Clowe's triumphalist attitude is only justified from the standpoint of [[standing on the shoulders of giants]]. It's not like he was publishing his &quot;proof&quot; of dark matter in a vacuum -- it was a particular point that was addressed to a particular (MOND-type) objection. However, when your hypothetical John Doe bucks the established research by publishing proof against dark matter, he is publishing in a vacuum. Prof. John Doe's work is marginal and therefore marginalized by Wikipedia. Clowe's work is mainstream and therefore reported by Wikipedia. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:47, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
::::::::SA is quite right about verifiability vs. editorial judgement.  However, I have to say I worry when editorial judgement of this type comes into dispute.  Wikipedia needs sources for two reasons: one is to have attributions in the articles, but another reason is that it levels the playing field in editorial discussions.  Inherently, experts on Wikipedia are not set above ordinary editors, but they may be more familiar with the subject in question.  But experts have to prove themselves, just like anyone else.  Fundamentally, Wikipedia is a community of equal editors.  So, this is a good argument ''for'' [[WP:SCIENCE]]: in order to avoid having to rely on editorial judgement too heavily, we look for a higher standard of quality in sources for scientific topics, and where that doesn't exist, we should avoid covering the subject.

:::::::::*Let's not mix up NPOV and editorial judgment. As I said earlier, the statement in the introduction is incorrect concerning NPOV. I also said it may concern notability, so I'm not dismissing the point. But let's be accurate as editors.
:::::::::*The idea that a community has informal discussions which a particular editor may be aware, is worthless. It is not verifiable, nor attributable. 
:::::::::*I know THREE different communities, all of whom have informal discussions, and promise peer reviewed papers that I could mention too. Also worthless.

:::::::::*I had previously brought this up at the Neutrality Project, see &quot;[[Wikipedia_talk:Neutrality_Project#NPOV_misunderstanding|NPOV misunderstanding]]&quot;. They agree. A singular POV can be described in an NPOV manner. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 16:01, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

NPOV is inherently based in editorial judgement. The only way that someone determines whether there is a problem with NPOV is by making an editorial judgement. That's why the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{POV}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag comes with the wording it does. Disputes arise between editors over NPOV: if there was a singular editor there would never be NPOV issues from the standpoint of writing an article. While I agree with Mangojuice that editors are judged external to their status as &quot;experts&quot; (see ongoing conflicts over [[WP:EXPERT]] for example), the community doesn't deny the existence of experts either. No one is saying that the encyclopedia should be &quot;run&quot; on expert judgement or the whispers of whatever anonymous and unaccountable ethnic group, but people are saying that editors may come to the table with these concerns. That's the essence of the NPOV guideline: all the points-of-view are placed on the table and the marginalization happens per the outside community and references to the outside world. No one is saying that a singular POV cannot be described, but people are saying that singular POVs present unique difficulties when writing an encyclopedia that is supposed to be NPOV. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 17:39, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

:*Indeed, all the POVs are placed on the table. And if there is just one POV (because there is one WP:V/WP:RS/WP:A), then we can still write that POV so that it conforms to NPOV, regardless of whether you or I or anyone else agrees with the POV, and regardless of whether it is mainstream of pseudoscience.
:*In which case, the statement in the third paragraph that I described above, is incorrect. A view from a single researcher may fail a criteria, but there is no reason for it to fail NPOV; and if it does, any decent editor can re-write it so that it conforms to NPOV. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 19:19, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
:::If there is only one notable POV, then sure, we write about it. In which case the statement in the third paragraph is correct. A view from a single research written about on Wikipedia does have editorial issues related to NPOV for the reasons delineated because the alternatives may exist but cannot be included without falling into original research. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 19:23, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
::::*The statement is incorrect because a single POV does not fail NPOV unless it is written badly, in which case any competent editor can correct it. Sure, the statement may be allowed because it is notable. But it won't fail because of NPOV.
::::*A single POV that has been published elsewhere does not not fail &quot;Original research&quot;, because [[WP:NOR]] &quot;refers to '''unpublished''' facts&quot;. (my emphasis) --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 19:51, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

You are missing the point. Perhaps I should post here the statement that you dispute:

:''Research published in a reputable publication passes these thresholds but reflects the point of view of one researcher or research term and, unless it generates a significant outside response by the scientific community or the population at large, focusing on such research in a Wikipedia article does not adequately conform to [[WP:NPOV|Wikipedia's policy on neutrality]], in particular the section on [[WP:NPOV#Undue weight|undue weight]].''

You'll note that the point being made is that simply quoting published work is not good enough. Why isn't it good enough? Because unless the work in question has generated discussion it has not been vetted outside of Wikipedia to make it possible to write an article on the subject that adheres to the spirit and letter of NPOV.
--[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 20:36, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
::The POV of a single researcher in a single first-rate peer-reviewed publication, has normally been assessed by 2 or usually 3 independent scientists with a tendency to be ciritical. The assumption made by colleagues it that such results are correct unless proven otherwise. Are we supposed to be more critical of physics that he physicists who review for PRL? Then, if discussed by independent sources, as most scientific papers are, it is considered worth citing and commenting one. Reputable journals expect items listed as references to be relevant to the new work also.

If your point is that someone can attribute a single point of view in a fashion that is NPOV, that is absolutely correct.

:*Since describing a single POV can be achieved in an NPOV fashion, then the description in the third paragraph is incorrect which says that a single POV without response fails NPOV.

I do not agree with the demand that not only must something be said in a respected peer reviewed journal, but that we must wait for other independent researchers to chime in, in OTHER respected peer reviewed journals, and agree with the first researcher that the claim is valid. The first post would constitute a reliable source satisfying [[WP:ATT]] and would be usable in a Wikipedia article. Similarly a book from a respected publisher would constitute a reliable source, without waiting for some other authority to write another book that says &quot;I agree with the first book.&quot; The demand places the bar way too high. It may be years before someone completely independent of the first researcher publishes the demanded blessing of the first researcher's claim. [[User:Edison|Edison]] 20:20, 9 April 2007 (UTC)

==[[Schmidt Sting Pain Index]]==
Can some of you knowledgable and discerning scientist Wikipedians take a look at this please? This article has currently been getting some coverage in popular &quot;gee whiz funny link of the day... how goofy!&quot; type blogs ( I hate it when this happens and the article in question is dubious... I think it gives a bad impression of wikipedia), but it seems to be mainly based on the idea that this one insect scientist guy wrote some goofy comments for an insect sting pain index one day. Ok, I agree that insect scientists are allowed to have senses of humour (WITHIN LIMITS, for the sake of us all), but I am concerned that 1) this scale is not really widespread and may be just one scale promoted by one guy without much acceptance in the insect expert community. 2) the pdf article linked which this wikipedia entry seems to be based on does not seem to say that Schmidt actually wrote those goofy comments. Its a bit ambiguous, but its seems to say that &quot;the media&quot; (without specifying what media) came up with the goofy comments to append to Schmidt's original dry scale(I think this may be another case where people exaggerate or misinterpret what an article is saying). I dont have any access to science journal databases, and am certainly no science or insect expert. But these concerns and quick scans of google books and google scholar led me to bring this issue to wiser heads. Thanks very much  for checking this out.

********Good: a direct response.  Two brief points: (1) Arbcom never asked for criteria, but they did encourage developing a guideline, which is different.  (2) The EU deletion debate looks very different to me - there, the argument was done from first principles and it worked very nicely, and it skirted around the edge of these criteria (no one ever talked about whether the EU concept was &quot;textbook science&quot; or had institutional support)... and as for extended discussions with Iantresman... I don't think the criteria will make one bit of difference, and that's not a very good reason anyway.  Long-winded debate... I don't think we should seek to avoid it as a general principle, debate is a good thing.  Criteria would simplify the job but scientific topics aren't exactly overwhelming the AfD lists.

I've added a brief section which is the meat from the numbers guideline.  This seems appropriately and neatly combined here.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 16:29, 15 May 2007 (UTC)
*It's a bad idea, as explained on the talk page of WP:NUM.

== Scope creep ==

I may be beating a dead horse here, but all the references to NPOV, proponents and advocacy make it seem like this is about pseudoscience/fringe science, and the discussion above seems to confirm it. As it tries to apply to specialised but uncontroversial science, not much of it bears any resemblance to reality. --[[User:Abu-Fool Danyal ibn Amir al-Makhiri|Abu-Fool Danyal ibn Amir al-Makhiri]] 02:29, 6 June 2007 (UTC)

== Proposal concerns (LV) ==
Note that I came here from a couple of AfDs which were trying to present this as policy criteria for an article's deleltion.  As I read down the line, I encountered several problems with the proposed guideline.  I apologize if any and all of the below have been covered in the Talk Archives, which I am not going to read now.

Problems that I have at present with the proposal:

*Introduction:
:* &quot;A topic that is acceptable under this guideline is an appropriate part of Wikipedia.&quot;
::Pretty sweeping blanket statement, to me.  No other Notability criteria I'm aware of suggests that &quot;if it passes this, it's in.&quot;  Indeed, it seems to violate the principle of a Guideline to me, which always limits itself to allow potential exceptions.  Further, each section usually defines which criteria are primary and which are secondary.
*Notability of topics related to science:
:*&quot;Decisions about including or excluding material must always reflect the opinions of outside authorities, not those of Wikipedia editors.&quot;
::I know this has been mentioned above, but I want to echo this concern:  Decisions about including or excluding material must always reflect the consensus of the Wikipedia editors.  Anything else beyond that is helpful clarification, or it becomes fodder for people to [[WP:IAR]].
::I'd feel much more comfortable with something like, ''&quot;Deicions about including or excluding material on a scientific basis ought to be supported by the opinions and stated facts of outside authorities, as per [[WP:RS|Wikpedia:Reliable Sources]].&quot;''  Start throwing 'musts' around in anything but policy (perhaps only unbreakable/unmodifiable policy) and you'll get a lot of irate editors, scientific or not.
:*&quot;Although publication creates verifiability and reputable journals are reliable sources, publication by itself is not a sufficient (and sometimes not necessary) standard for encyclopedic notability. Unpublished research fails no original research and often lacks verifiability, so it is unacceptable by policy. Research published in a reputable publication passes these thresholds but reflects the point of view of one researcher or research term and, unless it generates a significant outside response by the scientific community or the population at large, focusing on such research in a Wikipedia article does not adequately conform to Wikipedia's policy on neutrality, in particular the section on undue weight. This guideline clarifies how the Wikipedia community has applied NPOV to articles on scientific topics. It does however not apply to the inclusion of scientific research as authorative sources within articles. The criterion for such sources is not that they are notable, but that they are reliable.&quot;
::Wha?  Could this be any more complex?  I actually had to diagram this paragraph out to understand it.  My hypothesis is most editors will not.  Can't you simply say it is normally necessary to follow the general notability guidelines with respect to neutral, multiple, independent, verifiabile, reliable sources?  And if you do that, what is the point of this whole section - I'm seriously not understanding how this adds anything to present guidelines.
* Criteria / General
:*&quot;1. Widely cited. Papers covering the topic have been widely1 commented on in academic writing within the topic's field.
::2. Outside notability. The topic is notable due to significant coverage in reliable sources outside of academic publications.&quot;  
::So we want articles only commented upon widely by multiple academic sources, which also are commented on outside academic sources?  Seems pretty wide, to me.
::Aside from that, I know I read somewhere that Wikipedia is not just a general encyclopedia, but can cover articles appropriate to special subject encyclopedias as well.  Thus 2. might well fail, as most specialist encyclopedias I am aware of have many articles which would only be known inside the discipline the encyclopedia represents.
:*&quot;Notable topics which are primarily non-scientific... [etc.]&quot;
::Boy, I'm going to love the AfDs which try to define whether a topic is &quot;science&quot; or not trying to use this.  Not to mention the arguments you'll get whether or not cosmology (for example) has a scientific basis or not.  Not to mention you're setting up a criteria which is so subjective it will rarely-if-ever be able to objectively define where this guideline would be relevant or not.
::Also, you will get editors asking whether the guideline itself applies or not - something I don't think I've ever seen with any of the other specialty N's about the guideline ''itself''.  I don't need to know if Burpa-Cola has been covered in the Cola News and CNN, or if Billy Bob Arthbutnott has both parlimentary opinions as well as the Sun documenting his career to know that Corp or People:Politicians applies.
*Scientific terms
:Again, how does this get beyond neologisms in a way that Avoid Neologisms doesn't, aside from adding the words &quot;scientific literature&quot;?
*Numbers and Sources
:*&quot;1. Have professional mathematicians published papers on this topic?
::2. Is the sequence listed in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences? (In the case of sequences of rational numbers, does the OEIS have the sequences of numerators and denominators of the relevant fractions?)
::3. Do MathWorld and PlanetMath have articles on this topic?&quot;
:::This may be taken from WProj numbers, I don't know.  But are you stipulating that 2 and 3 are reliable sources? (The Sources section has exactly this same problem.  You're controlling what is considered a Reliable Source without allowing the Wikipedia community at large to define that.  I have a problem with that - if I were arguing Notability(Religion), I would not want it to say that the Bible is an authorized source and any other 'holy' texts by default would have to prove themselves.)
*Sources
:*&quot;Scientific discovery is often disconnected from public discourse, so standard methods of sourcing and verifying are not always applicable. A scientific topic which yields low hit counts in the Google test...&quot;
::That's nice.  The Google test is widely regarded as discredited anyway.  Yes, I know it's still used, but it's questionability is known.
::Also, verifying and sourcing is verfying and sourcing.  I believe what's being aimed at here is scientific notability may have a smaller and different base (with different types of sourcing) for inclusion than other forms of notability.  So why not say that?  Except that above you're demanding 'popular' coverage as well as academic.
:*&quot;Web (and library) searches should therefore be evaluated based on the quality rather than the quantity of the finds.&quot;
::Thus, you allow extreme subjectivity creep, unless you are going to make further instruction creep in what constitutes scientific quality.  (My Jung is better than your Freud.  My Hawking beats your Einstein.  My t test is better than your bean counting.)  Common sense might be able to dictate that, but science is full of periods of flying in the face of qualitative common sense and succeeding - because it's right.
:*&quot;The following is a list of sources with qualifications of their usefulness.&quot;
::Again, you're preaching what is and isn't acceptable as a source, without allowing the community consensus to decide this over time. 
:*&quot;Google, Yahoo.... [etc]&quot; 
::Uh, again, how is this any different from Google test?

Finally, may I invite you to consider that most notability guidelines are much less complex and much more tolerant of letting individual cases be decided as individual cases?  And I hope that the question about &quot;Have we reached consensus?&quot; is asking if you as the editors have reached consensus about what you want to present to the community as a whole, as opposed to &quot;Are we ready to make this policy ourselves?&quot;

It may seem like I'm pissing all over your proposal.  I hope it doesn't, because I'd like to see a Notability(Science) guideline.  But I want it to be one that's usable and used - I wouldn't do either with this, and I'd argue as need be when someone tries to use this as a vote justification (which will happen, whether you want it to or not.)  Sorry for the length of the diatribe.

The rejected tag is appropriate and should stand until there is adequate discussion here to demonstrate active interest in the proposal. As suggested by the policy, a proposal which has failed to gain support is better off rewritten and reintroduced as a new proposal.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 13:50, 20 August 2007 (UTC)

==Support or rejection for this proposal==
It looks like a number of the contributors here are no longer active at WP: Lantreman ws banned, BDJ and Science Appologist have quit, Minder Binder, Abu-Fool Danyal ibn Amir al-Makhiri, and Laughing Vulcan have not contributed substantially since June and at all since mid-July.   &lt;s&gt;Trials and Errors and Radiant are advocating reinstating this as a proposal&lt;/s&gt;, but I don't think that there are enough editors who see this as a need.

* What I see now is something that is so watered down and nebulous that it cannot act as a genuine policy.  If people want to revive this effort, then we need to return to a version like [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Notability_%28science%29&amp;oldid=117329647 this one] and work from there.  IMO, what happenned to this effort is that a number of people whose pet articles were running afoul of this proposed policy chose to get involved with the blatant intent to sabotage it and remove its impact on their work, and unfortunately succeeded in doing so.&lt;br&gt;IMO, there is a genuine need for a policy like this to clarify what &quot;notability&quot; and &quot;verifiability&quot; mean in the context of a science article, and how [[WP:UNDUE]] should be applied.  It may be that this is an issue that is best handled by the admins with the advice and consent of the community so that we can avoid the pitfalls of the past. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:49, 20 August 2007 (UTC)
*I see, if not frequent, so at least [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere/Wikipedia:Notability_%28science%29&amp;limit=500&amp;from=0 recurrent use] of this guideline/proposed guideline/essay, very much in keeping with the rather low number of science-related AfD discussions. Absence of discussion on the talk page certainly doesn't establish rejection. I agree with EMS that the two-item version is watered down beyond recognition of the original version, and I don't see any consensus for it. ~ [[User:Trialsanderrors|trialsanderrors]] 16:07, 20 August 2007 (UTC)
:: Per [[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines]]: ''&quot;A rejected page is any proposal for which consensus support is not present, regardless of whether there is active discussion or not. Consensus need not be fully opposed; if consensus is neutral on the issue and unlikely to improve, the proposal is likewise rejected. It is considered bad form to hide this fact, e.g. by removing the tag. Making small changes will not change this fact, nor will repetitive arguments. Generally it is wiser to rewrite a rejected proposal from scratch and start in a different direction.&quot;'' --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 16:14, 20 August 2007 (UTC)

::: It seems to me that a lot of work has gone into turning this into something that everyone can reject.  I have now reverted the article back to a more robust form, and hope that the process of making it a serious part of Wikpedia's policies and guidelines can now recomemnce. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 18:27, 20 August 2007 (UTC)

== Reverted to earlier version ==

I have reverted the article to the form of lat March, with some twaking of the lead and the first section.  The revised first section now has a simple first paragraph that states the need to this policy as succinctly as I can.  The next two paragraphs have had their order exchanged so that the farily dry &quot;relevance&quot; paragraph comes last.  The previous last paragraph has been removed as an unreadable mess.  (I believe I drafted that paragraph originally, but it really never worked as intended, and only got worse over time.)

The {{tl|rejected}} tag has been kept as a matter of form, with the {{tl|proposed}} tag just commented out but still present.  I for one would be happy to see this version go back to &quot;proposed&quot; status, but I want to see if others are on-board for doing that.  Let's just say that after having taken a rest, I am ready and willing to work towards acceptance of a functional version of this as a policy or guideline if others are. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 18:24, 20 August 2007 (UTC)

:Personally, I don't see a lot of point reviving this.  The criteria have always been an attempt to change practice rather than an attempt to document practice, and to most people, the criteria and the proposal are one and the same.  The criteria really haven't caught on, and from my experience, people rely on other policies for scientific topics, like [[WP:OR]] and [[WP:V]], and where notability is needed, the general [[WP:N]] seems to be sufficient and its use is accepted.

:: Having looked more closely at the edit history, I find that your attempt to streamline this two two items has met fairly stiff resistance.  Then again, that is little wonder since your proposed consolidation ends up being little more than a restatement of pre-existing policy.  The goal of this proposal is to set up guidelines that go beyond the current policies and which are adapted to the issues which are unique to science.  Wikiepdia has very much outgrown [[WP:NOR|&quot;No original research&quot;]] and the requirement to use [[peer review]]ed [[scientific journal|journals]].  What do you do with a source that is &quot;peer reviewed&quot; but where the peers are fellow followers of a [[fringe science|fringe theory]]?  What do you do about the use of [[Nature (journal)|Nature magazine]], which is highly respected but does not use peer review to help select its articles?  What do you make of a theory published in a respected scientific journals but on which noone has cared to comment except the author?  What do you do with the [[cold fusion]] controversy created by Pons and Fleishman back in 1987 which obviously is notable within science but which was never respected by it?  There will not be many of these to contend with, but when they do appear this guideline will be invaluable.
:::::Please excuse my comment here, but the article content of Nature is peer reviewed. Like some other journals, it has on rare occasions published things based on consensus of the key editors, without formal peer review. The news content is not, of course, just editorially prepared -- by the most careful people around. It was they who caught the similarity of the stem cell photos after the peer reviewers missed it.  '''[[User:DGG|DGG]]''' ([[User talk:DGG|talk]]) 22:22, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

:: You like to cite [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sorce theory]] as a place where this guideline did not work.  For that I solidly disagree.  That article's creator had to play all kinds of games with these criteria to make a case for keeping the article.  In the end, his attempts to make the article look acceptable only helped to do it in.  In context this is a farly powerful tool.  In addition, it is not going to do in fringe science articles.  For example, I helped by have an aritcle on a book by [[Halton Arp]] kept because it was noted within the field of astronomy and also gained some measure of attention from the public at large.  That press coverage (both scientific and popular) could establish notability as described here was helpful in that discussion. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 01:03, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

:::You might note that my reduction to two criteria stood for over two months without comment.  You may also note that coverage by press and by scientific sources were the criteria I left in place, since those are the only part of the criteria that are useful.  What I object to are the other criteria, like &quot;textbook science&quot; or &quot;popular belief&quot; that are redundant and provide loopholes for argumentative POV pushers.  Can you hypothesize an example where a topic is &quot;textbook science&quot; or has a &quot;prominent advocate&quot; or has &quot;institutional support&quot; where the topic would be acceptable for Wikipedia ''without'' significant coverage in independent, reliable sources, academic or otherwise?

::::I am not sure whether I agree with you or not. I certainly think that there are science articles that are best referenced by standard textbooks, particularly for articles that are at the level of high school or early university science. For example, we probably do not want to source a peer reviewed journal on [[density]] and we do not. Are textbooks reliable sources? If so we do not need to mention &quot;textbook science&quot;, but if they are not, we probable do. --[[User:Bduke|Bduke]] 03:09, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

:::::: I see no need to leave such things as &quot;texstbook science&quot; implicit.

::::::: As for the other criteria: you agree on 3 and 4.  6 is totally pointless, because none of the criteria would expire once met.  7 obviously must require sourcing to back it up or it's totally vacuous and anyone could claim it about anything.  And anything discussed in a legitimate textbook is already covered in a reliable source, and I highly doubt that we'd ever find a case where one textbook mentions a topic but absolutely no other sources do.  Yeah, I agree, if we pare it any further, the ''criteria'' say nothing more than [[WP:N]] does.. so maybe we should lose the criteria altogether, or just spend more time explaining the issues that arise in assessing the quality of sources, especially academic ones.

(unindent) I think that you have just made an excellent suggestions in calling for an explanation of how to assess the reliability and relevance of sources.  Given some of the issues I have had recently with the anti-relativists over at [[talk:Herbert Dingle]], this makes a lot of sense.  (In those discussions, at least one person would take anything that he could find from a &quot;peer reviewed journal&quot; as evidence of a conflict over relativity and the [[twin paradox]].  Said contributions come from almost unknown overseas journals and in another case a blatantly anti-relativity publisher.)  I would still keep the remaining criteria as a way of saying that those things are the primary hallmarks of scientific notability, while noting that other options for notability are not prohibited. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:20, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

:I believe that's better, but I still think we should remove the criteria.  The problem is, people always seem to conflate a notability guideline and its criteria, while all other text is ignored.  By not having criteria, we would force people to read the discussion about the reliability of scientific sources.  (Actually, come to think about it, &quot;Notability (science)&quot; may not be the best name.  What about &quot;Reliable sources (scientific)&quot;?)

:: The criteria don't exist for the benefit of those that would abuse them but instead for the benefit of those that are looking for good guidance on what is acceptable.  The creator of an article will invariably try to defend it against an AfD.  IMO, if the article's creator can make a case that their article is acceptable under this criteria and everyone agrees, then these criteria have done a service in helping people to make that decision.  Similarly, if people listen to the creator's case and conclude that it does not hold water, then the criteria will also have helped by focussing the debate on the relevant issues and helping to bring about the deletion.  So as I see it these criteria overall are helpful.  Besides, it really is in the absense of clear guidelines that you get the nastiest debates. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 19:01, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

(a) Notability, (b) reliability of a source, and (b) reliable of the facts in that source, are all quite different, and tell us how to describe information, not whether to include it. If Arp publishes some information in an obscure overseas publications, and Stephen Hawkins in in Nature, Arp's supporters will find his article more notable, and no less reliable. And if Hawkins is described in a textbook, then it tells us that his ideas have a wider readership, and neither are as popular as today's astrology column.  &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment was added by [[Special:Contributions/{{{IP|{{{User|84.244.165.174}}}}}}|{{{IP|{{{User|84.244.165.174}}}}}}]] ([[User talk:{{{IP|{{{User|84.244.165.174}}}}}}|talk]]) {{{Time|17:34, August 21, 2007 (UTC)}}}&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

: See [[WP:UNDUE]].  [[Halton Arp]]'s supporters today are an extremely limited minority, while [[Stephen Hawking]] and much of his research are well respected both scientifically and popularly.

==Abandon this as an unnecessary complication==

Whether a peer review journal, a textbook, a popular book, a university hosted website or a notable persons personal site  is sufficiently reliable, reputable, or secondary is probably best treated on a case by case basis, and in any case this is not a problem specific to science.

Are there any controversial articles that are better treated by Notability (science) than by WP:NOR, WPV, and WP:N?  I think not.  I think there are too many guidelines, especially where they overlap.  True science should only need to satisfy WP:NOR and WP:V.  Where the subject is not true science, or is borderline, a further test should be simply whether others have written about it.  WP:N provides this test.  A lot of work has been invested in this project page, but that is not sufficient reason to adopt it.  It is rule creep, and it does damage by obfuscating more important policies and guidelines.

There seems to be tendency here for some to want a guideline to provide a science-quality test.  This is not an encyclopaedia’s role.  The ascribing of “Finge science”, “pseudo science” or “lunacy” to any theory is a job for third party sources, not for wikipedia rules.  

EMS suggests that some nasty debates exist because of the weakness of this guideline.  Some elaboration would be nice.  Discussion above suggests to me that the relativity article needs work, not that wikipedia needs more rules.

This project page should be abandoned.  Science is well covered by WP:OR and WP:V, and where notability is needed, the general WP:N seems to be sufficient and its use is accepted. --[[User:SmokeyJoe|SmokeyJoe]] 02:08, 22 August 2007 (UTC)

::::::OK.  I looked at them.  It seems to me that there aren’t very many, and none of them are really science issues.  Science is merely involved.  It’s always about sourcing, specifically whether the sources are sufficiently independent, sufficiently secondary, sufficiently reputable (not a blog or similar), or covers the subject in sufficient depth.  These are all straight WP:N issues, deriving directly from a combination of WP:NOR and WP:V.  There is plenty of evidence of spirited debate in places about the science of the content involved, and this sometimes is uncivil, but such spirited debate seems to me to be irrelevant to the debates, and always a symptom of editors who are too far into OR editing and are not looking at the subject objectively.  This is why Notability (science) may do more harm than good.  It suggests that there is something special about science.  The criteria for inclusion in wikipedia do not depend upon the science.

==physics? i think not==
do not confuse the observer effect with the uncertainty principle. the uncertainty principle has nothing to do with &quot;observing&quot;, it has to do with measuring. the observer effect is a supposed effect of observing an event and the influence of your presence on the event. no one would ever have to actually observe a particle's position to obfuscate its momentum, the mere act of using the photons to measure its position, even if nobody ever observed it, would suffice.

-------------
don't you have to observe in order to measure?
-------------

Indeed.  But what does measuring have to do with Quantum Mechanics exactly?  

To measure is to observe the results of a measurement process [that ascertains the subject measurement].  Humans observe with their senses — the senses that humans have.  Other conscious beings, perhaps including computers, may have other senses with which they can implement tools for making measurements.  At the end of the day, measuring ''ALWAYS'' involves observing.  

Tools used by beings to make measurements are limited (in their accuracy) by various factors including the limitations of ones senses.  The often-mentioned example of bouncing a photon off of an atom to measure its position illustrates the problem with knowing the position ''AND'' momentum of ''THAT'' atom at the ''SAME MOMENT'' in time.  The concept usually centers on the fact that the position measurement photon will change the momentum of the subject atom.  But aren't there other aspects of this problem?  

In the limit (considering the non-zero mass of the atom and the non-zero energy of the photon), can one ever know perfectly even the position alone?  Perhaps so, since the mechanical inertance of the atom precludes its reaction at ''THAT'' infinitesimal instant in time.  

Why is not ''THIS'' example an instance of &quot;observer effect&quot; rather than the uncertainty principle, per se?  If one seeks only to measure the position alone, then maybe it is neither.  Then again, is it not &quot;Observer Effect&quot; even if the momentum is changed by measuring only the position?  One would think so.  

Well, what if we start with measuring the momentum &quot;first&quot;?  How does one measure momentum, anyway?  Again, we observers devise a measurement process that allows our senses to detect the &quot;answer.&quot;  Momentum is mass times velocity.  If we know the mass, we might then seek to measure the velocity.  Human observers tend to ascertain velocity by measuring position at two points in time.  For non-zero velocities, this means two different points in space, of course.  Yet, [instantaneous] velocity is ''DEFINED'' at only one point in space and time.  Thus, one cannot measure velocity (or momentum) in this manner: one must ''WAIT'' to ''SEE'' how fast it is moving, and this yields only an average (not instantaneous) value.  

Before continuing on to propose measuring momentum, per se, by some other means (say, smashing the atom into an obstacle at a known position), we should note that the Uncertainty Principle pertains only to Quantum Mechanics.  In ''THAT'' world, particles are not particles; rather, they are probability density functions.  The interpretation of this ''MODEL'' of a particle says the position and momentum of the subject particle are INHERENTLY uncertain by virtue of the mathematical model itself.  To precisely derive the position, one must manipulate the model in a manner that causes the momentum &quot;to drop out of the formula,&quot; and vice versa.  

The relationship between position and momentum described by Quantum Mechanics is somewhat like the relationship between the time domain and the frequency domain described by the Fourier Transform.  One can say that there is some similarity as well between position and velocity in Classical Mechanics.  In fact, the description above with knowing the velocity versus position of the atom is exactly that: Classical Mechanics. 

Following this line of thinking, one (''such as this user who is not fluent in the intricate semantics of Quantum Theory'') might be likely to reach these conclusions: 
 

'''1. Using &quot;particulate&quot; atoms and photons to describe the Uncertainty Principle of Quantum Mechanics is ''flat wrong''.''' 

'''2. One does not observe Quantum Mechanics.  Rather, one uses that theory to make calculations to explain the observations of certain experiments.'''

'''3. Measurements ''ALWAYS'' involve observations and therefore also ''ALWAYS'' involve the Observer Effect.  Perhaps this ''IS'' the “Theory of the Observer Effect.”'''

'''4. The Uncertainty Principle of Quantum Mechanics and the Observer Effect are ''fundamentally'' unrelated.'''  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:JimRodgers|JimRodgers]] ([[User talk:JimRodgers|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/JimRodgers|contribs]]) 12:54, 31 July 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

For some reason this article is more focused on what the observer effect is not. --[[User:Nathanael Bar-Aur L.|Nathanael Bar-Aur L.]] 20:09, 10 April 2007 (UTC)

From what I understood from other sources, the observer effect is basically the collapsing of a quantum system's wavefunction that happens the moment a measurement in made upon it (by an &quot;observer&quot;), therefore cancelling any superposition that may have existed beforehand, and giving specific definition to the renderings. Is this correct? --[[User:Nathanael Bar-Aur L.|Nathanael Bar-Aur L.]] 20:21, 10 April 2007 (UTC)

==Suggestions==
Current article states &quot;not that of the driveshaft, along the axis of the car&quot;.
Add a paragraph that illustrates this with the driveshaft of the front-engine, rear-wheel-drive Porsche 928.
Also industrial examples and diagrams from mechanical engineering and classical mechanics.
e.g. a torque tube to allign parts of a hinge operated by two hydraulic cylinders.&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/206.188.57.60|206.188.57.60]] ([[User talk:206.188.57.60|talk]]) 14:42, 30 October 2006 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;

== Diagrams ==

==Accuracy==
This page is not really accurate. Cars like the STS, Corvette, etc. have independent rear suspensions, and the torque tube is not used to transmit acceleration forces in these vehicles. Rather, it is because they have trans-axles in the rear of the car and it connects the trans-axle with the engine in the front. However, I am not enough of an expert on the subject to write a clear and well-written clarification so I have just added some templates to the top of the page. --[[User:Ozziegt|Ozziegt]] ([[User talk:Ozziegt|talk]]) 21:33, 1 July 2009 (UTC)

:Corvette since at least 1988 doesn't have a torque tube (unless they put one in later), and apart from the Miata I'm hard pushed to think of an IRS that uses one. I agree, this article is pretty horrid, it needs a rewrite rather than refs. [[User:Greglocock|Greglocock]] ([[User talk:Greglocock|talk]]) 11:13, 2 July 2009 (UTC)

:Corvettes since the late 90's do indeed have torque tubes, of the same type that the Porsche 924/944/928 etc use.  All the mentioned Porsches are IRS and use a torque tube.  Part of the probem with this article is that it lumps very diverse systems together;  the early Ford systems are completely different from the Corvette/Porsche systems.  Both are classified as torque tubes, but the article does not focus on the essence of a TT, which is the use of a smaller torque-transmitting element inside a carrier. The carrier may or may not be static and may or may not be carrying driveline forces (like the Fords). [[User:52FordF-1|52FordF-1]] ([[User talk:52FordF-1|talk]]) 15:44, 18 July 2009 (UTC)

::Yup my bad, 2005 Corvette (as a random example) uses a transaxle and a torque tube. Note that the Corvette system is different to the Peugoet one, as the latter includes an articulating joint at the front whereas the Corvette system does not. This is a big deal, to a driveline engineer at least.[[User:Greglocock|Greglocock]] ([[User talk:Greglocock|talk]]) 23:25, 18 July 2009 (UTC)

:Agreed. The article as written is essentially BS. A torque tube fundamentally counteracts the torque of the driveshaft; the alternative is that the torque is counteracted by the torsional rigidity of the frame (the net torque must, obviously, be zero otherwise the rear of the car would rotate). The torque tube often does transfer forward wheel force to the front of the car, but this is not inherent in the mere fact of having a torque tube: there must still be a mechanism locating the wheels longitudinally relative to the diff/transaxle. This is analogous to the usual need to locate the wheels relative to the frame (most simply, with leaf springs) in order to move the car forward.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/110.175.57.184|110.175.57.184]] ([[User talk:110.175.57.184|talk]]) 05:05, 18 March 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== simple definition? ==

It has been my understanding from looking through service manuals and talking to mechanics that the corvette style torque tubes are just an enclosed driveshaft that connects a front mounted engine to the rear mounted transmission (with fully independent rear suspension)

I guess it's not simply called a 'driveshaft' in a classical sense since it doesn't connect a front mounted transmission to the rear differential  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/184.57.87.173|184.57.87.173]] ([[User talk:184.57.87.173|talk]]) 20:38, 15 August 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</text>

'''''Hello!'''''

Thanks for uploading some pictures to Wikipedia.  I wanted to make sure you were aware of some of the requirements and good practices for uploaded images.

*'''Pick an image name.'''
:When [[Special:Upload|uploading]] an image, pick a file name that is descriptive, and unique.  Remember that many images may be uploaded about the same topic, and remember that names are case sensitive.

*'''Source the image.'''
:On the [[Help:Image page|image description page]], explain where the image came from.  If you created the image yourself, then say so.  If it's from the web, give a URL.  If it's a screenshot of a movie or game, or a scan from a book, give the title.

*'''Provide copyright and license information.'''
:This part is a little bit trickier, but it's very important.  The copyright of the image generally belongs to whomever created it.
::''If it's a photograph you took, or an image you created'' (modifying an image that already exists doesn't count) in software like [[Photoshop]] or [[GIMP]], then you own the copyright.  To upload it to Wikipedia, you must agree to license it under the [[GFDL]] (which allows anyone to use it, but requires that they give credit to the original author and requires that any further edit to the image be licensed under the GFDL as well) or release it into the [[public domain]] (which allows anyone to use it for any purpose without restriction.)  Do this by placing an appropriate [[WP:ICT|tag]] on the [[Wikipedia:image description page|image description page]], like &amp;#123;{[[Template:GFDL|GFDL]]}} or &amp;#123;{[[Template:PD|PD]]}}.  Be sure to mention that you created the image.  If you're using &amp;#123;{[[Template:PD|PD]]}}, you may also want to use &amp;#123;{[[Template:NoRightsReserved|NoRightsReserved]]}}, since there is some dispute as to whether one may grant items into the public domain.
::''If you didn't create the image,'' or the copyright somehow belongs to another party (like a screenshot, which you might &quot;create&quot;, but the copyright belongs to the author of the movie or video game), then you need to find another [[WP:ICT|tag]] that describes the copyright status of the image.  Images used on Wikipedia need to be free for our use and the use of [[WP:FORKS|sites]] which reproduce our content.  This means that images cannot have a restriction such as &quot;only for use by Wikipedia&quot;, or &quot;for non-commercial use only&quot;, or &quot;for educational use&quot;.  Images without a free license may be usable in certain articles under [[WP:FU|fair use]], but such a use should be justified on the image description page.

*'''Describe the image.'''
:To another reader, the image may not be immediately understood.  A caption in an article doesn't explain the image to a visitor who sees it on its image page.  Put a brief explanation of what is in the image on the image description page, similar to what you might include in a caption on an article.  

Some links to Wikipedia pages on this subject: 

'''[[Wikipedia:Copyrights#Image guidelines|Copyrights]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags|Copyright tags]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Fair use|Fair use]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Image description page|Image description page]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Granting work into the public domain|Public domain]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion|Images for deletion]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Possibly unfree images|Possibly unfree images]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Copyright problems|Copyright problems]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Uploading images|Uploading images]]'''

==Image tagging for Image:LarryTee1.jpg==
Thanks for uploading '''[[:Image:LarryTee1.jpg]]'''. The image has been identified as not specifying the source and creator of the image, which is required by Wikipedia's policy on images. If you don't indicate the source and creator of the image on the image's description page, it may be deleted some time in the next seven days. If you have uploaded other images, please verify that you have provided source information for them as well.

An '''anti-submarine missile'''  is a [[standoff missile|standoff]] [[anti-submarine weapon]]. Often a variant of [[anti-ship missile]] designs an anti-submarine systems typically use a [[jet engine|jet]] or [[rocket engine|rocket]] engine, to deliver: an [[explosive material|explosive]] [[warhead]] aimed directly at a [[submarine]]; a [[depth charge]], or;  a homing [[torpedo]] that is carried from a launch ship, or other  platform, to the vicinity of a target.
[[File:Ikara missile.JPG|thumb|right|&lt;small&gt;[[Ikara (missile)|Ikara]], an [[Australia]]n-designed missile used by several navies between the 1960s and 1990s; a [[rocket engine|rocket]]-parachute delivery system carried an [[acoustic torpedo]] up to 10 nautical miles (19 km) after launch. A variant re-designed in the UK and used by the Royal Navy could deliver a [[Nuclear depth bomb|nuclear depth charge]].&lt;/small&gt;]]
[[File:Maille-Braize-14.jpg|thumb|&lt;small&gt;The [[Malafon]], used by the French Navy between 1966 and 1997, used a rocket-assisted glider to carry a torpedo up to 8 nautical miles (13 km) after launch&lt;/small&gt;. ]]

==History==
[[Depth charge]]s were the earliest weapons designed for use by ships against submerged [[submarine]]s. These explosives were initially dropped as the ship moved over the presumed location of a submarine. Before World War II, shipboard [[sonar]] was unable to maintain contact with a submarine at close range. 

Various [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]]-type projectors, including [[hedgehog (weapon)|hedgehog]] and [[squid (weapon)|squid]], were devised during [[World War II]] to allow a ship to maintain sonar contact while lobbing explosive charges toward the submarine.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Terry, and Costello, John ''The Battle of the Atlantic'' (1977) Dial Press {{Listed Invalid ISBN|0-8037-6454-2}} pp.307-308&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the [[Cold War]], [[missile]]s were developed to provide greater range with reduced [[recoil]]. Some missiles and rockets carry [[homing torpedo]]es to provide terminal guidance for the warhead.&lt;ref&gt;Albrecht, Gerhard ''Weyer's Warships of the World'' (1969) United States Naval Institute p.385&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''northern river shark''' or '''New Guinea river shark''' (''Glyphis garricki'') is a [[species]] of [[requiem shark]], in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Requiem shark|Carcharhinidae]] found in scattered [[tidal river]]s and associated coastal waters in northern [[Australia]] and in [[Papua New Guinea]]. This species inhabits areas with poor visibility, soft bottoms, and large [[tide]]s, with immature sharks ranging into [[freshwater|fresh]] and [[brackish water]]. It is similar to other river sharks in having a stocky grey body with a high back, tiny eyes, and broad fins. It measures up to {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} long.

Northern river sharks are likely [[piscivorous]]. This species is [[viviparous]], with females bearing litters of 9 young possibly every other year before the [[wet season]]. Very rare and facing threats from [[commercial fishing|commercial]] and [[recreational fishing]], and perhaps also [[habitat degradation]], this species has been assessed as [[Critically Endangered]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]].

==Taxonomy==
The first known specimens of the northern river shark, two newborn males from Papua New Guinea, were discovered by [[New Zealand]] [[ichthyologist]] [[Jack Garrick]], after whom the species was eventually  named. This shark was referred to as &quot;''Glyphis'' sp. C&quot; until 2008, when it was formally described by [[Leonard Compagno]], William White, and [[Peter R. Last]] in a [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] paper. The [[type specimen]] is a female {{convert|67|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, collected from the [[East Alligator River]], [[Kakadu National Park]], [[Northern Territory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Compagno, L.J.V. |author2=W.T.

==Distribution and habitat==
The northern river shark has been reported from [[King Sound]], the [[Ord River]], and Doctors Creek near [[Derby, Western Australia]], the [[Adelaide River|Adelaide]] and [[Alligator Rivers]] in Australia's [[Northern Territory]], and the [[Daru]] region and possibly the [[Fly River]] in Papua New Guinea. It inhabits large [[river]]s, [[estuaries]], and coastal [[bay]]s, all of which are characterized by high [[turbidity]], silty or muddy bottoms, and large tides. Young and juvenile sharks are found in fresh, brackish, and salt water ([[salinity]] ranging from 2 to 36 ppt), whereas adults have only been found in marine environments.&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pillans et al&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pillans, R.D. |author2=J.D.

==Description==
Like other members of its genus, the northern river shark has a stocky body with a high back. The head is wide and flattened, with a broadly rounded snout and minute eyes equipped with [[nictitating membrane]]s. Each [[nostril]] is divided into a very large incurrent opening and a small excurrent opening by a triangular skin flap. The sizable mouth is broadly arched, with short furrows at the corners. Thirty-one to 34 tooth rows are in the upper jaw and 30&amp;ndash;35 tooth rows are in the lower jaw; the upper teeth are upright and triangular with serrated edges, while the lower teeth are narrower and straight to slightly curved. In the largest individuals, the first few lower teeth from the jaw median are spear-shaped with serrations near the tip.&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;/&gt;

The [[pectoral fin]]s are large and broad, with gently backward-curving margins and pointed tips. The [[pelvic fin]]s are triangular with nearly straight trailing margins. The first [[dorsal fin]] is long-based and triangular, with the apex almost forming a right angle; the second dorsal fin is some two-thirds as high as the first. The origin of the first dorsal fin lies over the pectoral fin insertions, while that of second dorsal fin lies over the pelvic fin rear tips. No ridge exists between the dorsal fins. The [[anal fin]] is smaller than the second dorsal fin and has a strong notch in the rear margin. The [[caudal fin]] has a strong lower lobe and a long, narrow upper lobe with a ventral notch near the tip. The [[dermal denticle]]s are small, oval, and overlapping, bearing three horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth. This shark is steel-gray above and white below; the color transition is sharp, located well below the eye, and becomes jagged on the sides of the trunk. The anal and caudal fins become dusky or black towards the trailing margins and tips. The maximum known length is {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}}. This species differs from the [[speartooth shark]] (''G. glyphis'') in several [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] and [[meristic]] characters, including having fewer [[vertebra]]e (137&amp;ndash;151 versus 213&amp;ndash;222) and a lower, jagged gray-white color boundary.&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;/&gt;

==Biology and ecology==
With its slender teeth, small eyes, and high density of [[ampullae of Lorenzini]], the northern river shark seems to be [[adaptation|adapted]] for hunting [[fish]] in conditions of poor visibility. In Doctors Creek, sharks may move to and from favored feeding areas with the tide.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thorburn, D.C., D.L. Morgan, A.J. Rowland and H.S. Gill. (February 2004). [http://www.environment.gov.au/coasts/publications/pubs/glyphis-wa.pdf The northern river shark (''Glyphis'' sp. C) in Western Australia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108234623/http://environment.gov.au/coasts/publications/pubs/glyphis-wa.pdf |date=8 November 2011 }}. Report to the National Heritage Trust, Murdoch University. Retrieved on 10 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Like other requiem sharks, this species is [[viviparous]], with the developing [[embryo]]s forming a [[placenta]]l connection to their mother after exhausting their supply of [[yolk]]. Females give birth around October, before the start of the [[wet season]], on possibly a biennial cycle. One female examined contained nine [[fetus]]es.&lt;ref name=&quot;pillans et al&quot;/&gt; The young are born at under {{convert|67|cm|in|abbr=on}} long; males [[sexual maturity|mature]] between lengths of {{convert|1.2|and|1.4|m|ft|abbr=on}}, while females mature between lengths of {{convert|1.4|and|1.7|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;/&gt;

==Human interactions==
The northern river shark appears to be extremely rare, though more subpopulations may remain to be discovered in Australia and Papua New Guinea. Based on present information, no more than 250 mature individuals are estimated to exist in the wild, with no more than 50 in any particular subpopulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt; This species is caught legally and illegally by [[commercial fisheries]] using [[longline fishing|longlines]] and [[gillnet]]s, as well as by [[recreational fishing|recreational fishers]]; [[habitat degradation]] may pose a further threat to its survival. Because of its low natural abundance, limited distribution, stringent habitat requirements, and susceptibility to various human-caused threats, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] has assessed the northern river shark as [[critically endangered]]. It has also been listed as endangered on the 1999 Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, and on the 2000 Territory Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act. Kakadu National Park may be an important protected area for this species.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt; No regulations restrict the capture of this species in Papua New Guinea.&lt;ref name=&quot;white et al&quot;/&gt;

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Zoidberg. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Zoidberg~enwiki that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]]. If you think you might own all of the accounts with this name and this message is in error, please visit [[Special:MergeAccount]] to check and attach all of your accounts to prevent them from being renamed.

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== Hare Krishna picture ==

There is a picture of a Hare Krishna procession in the [[Religion_in_Mexico#Buddhism|Buddhism]] section, even with a caption about them being buddhists. Hare Krishnas are not buddhists, they are hindus. The article is semi-protected so I can not correct that myself. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Wenzelkarbovski|Wenzelkarbovski]] ([[User talk:Wenzelkarbovski|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Wenzelkarbovski|contribs]]) 17:39, 22 April 2015 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Self-ascription fallacy ==

''The last census reported, by self-ascription, that over 95% of the population is Christian.''

The so-called self-ascription of the census is nothing but a silly way of measuring data. Obviously they count children as Christians just because their parents say so. This people should either be clear about this or not count children at all. By the way, since a couple of years ago the Catholic Church has started to indoctrinate [[Huichol]] kids. Shame on us, Mexicans. Shame on us... The Huichols were one of the very few indigenous people whose religious tradition haven't been polluted by Catholicism but now the church has started taking advantage of the poverty of this people and the new constitutional reforms to infiltrate to their villages and improvise &quot;schools&quot;. Of course they know that adults wouldn't let themselves be indoctrinated so they choose to attack young minds. Catholicism and ignorance have been the ingredients of our condition as a Third World country.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Scandza|Scandza]] ([[User talk:Scandza|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Scandza|contribs]]) 13:27, 30 May 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;


Can anyone explain why the Evangelical Free Church of America does so many, many missionary trips to Mexico, when it's a predominantly catholic country? I mean, there are definite ideological differences involved, but I wasn't aware the two churches actively tried to convert each other's members.


==First phrase==

Any interest in removing &quot;Unlike some other Latin American countries&quot; from the first sentence of the article? It does not seem to serve any objective purpose and seems slightly antagonistic.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Namenderkrieg|Namenderkrieg]] ([[User talk:Namenderkrieg|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Namenderkrieg|contribs]]) 15:34, 24 March 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Easter==

I'm removing this:

&quot;Some of them however, do not celebrate Easter because they think that the Easter Bunny is the devil. Instead of celebrating Easter, they like to eat Mexican Pizzas.&quot;

because it's obviously untrue and just stupid. I think the article should be rewritten though, by someone more experienced than I am.--[[User:PARCGOP|PARCGOP]] 14:09, 7 April 2007 (UTC)

==Contradiction?==
This article says that 95% of people in Mexico are Roman Catholic.  The Mexico article states that 95% of people are Christian, and only 89% are Roman Catholic.  Which is correct, or am I just confused?
[[User:Yumecosmos|Yumecosmos]] ([[User talk:Yumecosmos|talk]]) 02:20, 9 January 2008 (UTC)

== Rewriting ==

I have imported the Religion section from the article on [[Mexico]] and integrated the information that was only on this article. I also moved around paragraphs and added a subtitle to make reading easier. Finally I removed the stub templates and replaced it with the expand one. --[[User:Marianika|Marianika]] ([[User talk:Marianika|talk]]) 16:32, 19 May 2008 (UTC)

== What about non-believers? ==

What about atheists, agnostics, deists in Mexico? How many Mexicans actually believe in God? Is there any data about that?  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/213.196.243.113|213.196.243.113]] ([[User talk:213.196.243.113|talk]]) 22:41, 27 May 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Mexican Ethnic Religion (Mexicayotl) ==

This article lacks a part about the growing movement of Mexicayotl, or Ethnic Mexican Culture or Religion, which is the revival of &quot;Aztec&quot; religion. --[[Special:Contributions/79.45.49.143|79.45.49.143]] ([[User talk:79.45.49.143|talk]]) 12:47, 16 August 2010 (UTC)

== Typo in Nonreligious section ==

'''John Ralph Ragazzini''' (January 3, 1912&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pnxBAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=John+Ralph+Ragazzini+1912&amp;dq=John+Ralph+Ragazzini+1912&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjC4sew9dPVAhXMHJoKHeWmAFsQ6AEIKzAB Profile of John Ralph Ragazzini]&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; November 22, 1988) was an [[United States|American]] [[electrical engineer]] and a professor of [[Electrical Engineering]]. 

==Biography==
Ragazzini was born in [[Manhattan, New York City]] and received the degrees of B.S. and E.E. at the [[City College of New York]] in 1932 and 1933 and earned the degrees of A.M. and Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at [[Columbia University]] in 1939 and 1941.

Ragazzini was dean of the School of Engineering and Science at [[New York University]] and during [[World War II]] he was chairman of the Department of Electrical Engineering at Columbia University, where he was involved in the [[Manhattan Project]].

Ragazzini's notable students are [[Rudolf E. Kálmán]] (see [[Kalman filter]]s), [[Eliahu Ibraham Jury]] (see [[Z-transform]]), [[Gene F. Franklin]] (see [[digital control]]), and [[Lotfi Asker Zadeh]] (see [[Fuzzy sets]] and [[Fuzzy logic]]).

Ragazzini is also credited, along with Lotfi Zadeh, in 1952, to have pioneered the development of the [[z-transform]] method in [[discrete-time]] [[signal processing]] and analysis.

In 1970 he received the [[Rufus Oldenburger Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asme.org/about-asme/honors-awards/achievement-awards/rufus-oldenburger-medal |title=Rufus Oldenburger Medal |publisher=[[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] |accessdate={{Format date|2013|2|14}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, [[American Automatic Control Council]] named [[John R. Ragazzini Award]] after Ragazzini and he was the first recipient of the award. Ragazzini died on 22 November 1988, aged 76.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/24/obituaries/john-ragazzini-76-educator-and-engineer.html&lt;/ref&gt;

I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under [[Wikipedia:Fair use|fair use]] but there is no [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline|explanation or rationale]] as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags/Fair use|boilerplate fair use template]], you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with [[WP:FU|fair use]].

Please go to [[:Image:Brokeninpieces.jpg|the image description page]] and edit it to include a [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline |fair use rationale]]. Using one of the templates at [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline]] is an easy way to insure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template. Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.

If there is other other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on the other images used on this page.

The '''United Church, Chapel on the Hill''' in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]] was the city's main church during [[World War II]]. Dedicated on September 30, 1943 and completed late in October 1943, it was originally a multi-denominational [[chapel]] shared by [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and [[Judaism|Jewish]] congregations.&lt;ref name=NationalRegister/&gt;&lt;ref name=churchhistory&gt;[http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=category&amp;sectionid=4&amp;id=39&amp;Itemid=55 Church History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728092956/http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=category&amp;sectionid=4&amp;id=39&amp;Itemid=55 |date=July 28, 2011 }}, United Church, Chapel on the Hill website, accessed March 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architectural design ==
The building design is a [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] 700-series [[U.S. Army]] chapel.&lt;ref name=Townsite&gt;[http://oakridgevisitor.com/history/pdf/OriginalTownSites.pdf Chapel on the Hill] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517124718/http://oakridgevisitor.com/history/pdf/OriginalTownSites.pdf |date=May 17, 2008 }} in ''Jackson Square – the original Townsite'', Oak Ridge Convention and Visitors' Bureau&lt;/ref&gt; It is a frame building built on a three-bay rectangular plan with a [[Steeple (architecture)|steeple]]d [[bell tower]] and a [[gable]] entry [[porch]]. It was one of three Army chapels built using the same design in Oak Ridge during World War II. One of the other two chapels, the West Chapel in the city's West Village area, was later torn down, but the East Chapel in the East Village is still in use.&lt;ref name=NationalRegister&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfo.doe.gov/me70/history/NPSweb/Oak_Ridge_Historic_District_(Preferred).pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form for Oak Ridge Historic District |date=July 18, 1991 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829041710/http://www.cfo.doe.gov/me70/history/NPSweb/Oak_Ridge_Historic_District_%28Preferred%29.pdf |archivedate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The U.S. Army built the chapel to house religious activities, as one of numerous community facilities in the &quot;townsite&quot; area of Oak Ridge. The building was dedicated on September 30, 1943, in a ceremony that included [[prayer]]s and talks by a Jewish [[rabbi]], a [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|Catholic priest]], an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] priest, a [[Baptist]] minister, and the [[minister (Christianity)|minister]] who was serving the United Church congregation that eventually came to own the chapel.&lt;ref&gt;Charles W. Johnson and Charles O. Jackson (1981), ''City Behind a Fence: Oak Ridge, Tennessee, 1942-1946''. The University of Tennessee Press. Pages 127-129.&lt;/ref&gt; Its name, &quot;The Chapel on the Hill,&quot; comes from a reference in a prayer by the Knoxville Baptist minister who participated in the dedication.&lt;ref name=Townsite/&gt;

The United Church congregation that is housed in the Chapel on the Hill traces its history to July 18, 1943, when some 25 to 30 Christians of diverse denominational backgrounds gathered for Sunday worship in Oak Ridge's main [[cafeteria]]. Subsequently, several members of the group made plans to establish an interdenominational Protestant church, led by [[laity|layperson]]s, to include all denominations. A [[Presbyterian]] minister working in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] was engaged to conduct weekly services, and about 150 people representing 13 Protestant denominations became charter members of &quot;the United Church&quot;. Governing boards of laypersons elected to lead the new congregation took up their duties on October 24, 1943.&lt;ref name=pre1980&gt;[http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=51&amp;Itemid=55 Pre-1980 Historical Compilation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728093006/http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=51&amp;Itemid=55 |date=July 28, 2011 }}, United Church, Chapel on the Hill website, accessed March 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Chapel-on-the-Hill was completed that same month, the United Church and the local Roman Catholic Church were given control of the building, as the only two churches then officially operating in the [[Manhattan Project]] community. During the war, when Oak Ridge's Manhattan Project facilities were operating around the clock, the chapel building was also in use nearly 24 hours a day as a venue for worship services, [[wedding]]s, and other occasions for local workers of various Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish religious backgrounds.&lt;ref name=pre1980/&gt;

At the peak of wartime activity in Oak Ridge, when the population exceeded 70,000, the United Church employed four ministers and conducted worship services in the Chapel on the Hill, East Village Chapel, and the Jefferson Theater, as well as [[Sunday school]] classes in several local schools and a [[mobile home|trailer]] camp. By 1951, the United Church Chapel-on-the-Hill consolidated as a single [[interdenominational]] congregation, making its home in the Chapel on the Hill building.&lt;ref name=pre1980/&gt;

The United Church congregation purchased the chapel and {{convert|3.72|acre|ha}} of land from the [[U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]] on May 11, 1955 for a price of $17,116.&lt;ref name=pre1980/&gt; An adjoining educational building was added in 1956-1957.

It is felt that the article you created at [[Ethan cavett]] is not suitable for a Wikipedia article, which must have a [[Wikipedia:Notability|notable]] subject and be [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verifiable]]. I have moved it to [[User:{{PAGENAME}}]], which is where users are free to write about themselves. You are at liberty to move it back into the (Main) namespace but bear in mind that if you do so, it is likely to be nominated for deletion. 

Note, however, that the purpose of a user page is to enable active editors of Wikipedia to introduce themselves to other editors. [[WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_a_blog.2C_webspace_provider.2C_or_social_networking_site|Wikipedia is not a general hosting service]], so your user page is not a personal homepage. Content unrelated to Wikipedia or its editing is likely to be removed.

Please see [[WP:User_page|the user page guidelines]], especially [[WP:User_page#What_can_I_not_have_on_my_user_page.3F|this section]] for more information. -- [[User:Omicronpersei8|Omicronpersei8]] ([[User talk:Omicronpersei8|talk]]) 19:36, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

'''Archer''' is a [[slab serif]] typeface designed in 2001 by [[Tobias Frere-Jones]] and [[Jonathan Hoefler]] for use in ''[[Martha Stewart Living]]'' magazine. It was later released by [[Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones]] for commercial licensing.

==Structure==

The typeface is a [[Slab_serif#Geometric_model|geometric]] slab serif, one with a geometric design similar to sans-serif fonts. It takes inspiration from mid-twentieth century designs such as [[Rockwell (typeface)|Rockwell]].

The face is unique for combining the geometric structure of twentieth-century European slab-serifs but imbuing the face with a domestic, less strident tone of voice. [[Ball terminal|Balls]] were added to the upper terminals on letters such as ''C'' and ''G'' to increase its charm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Devroye|first1=Luc|title=Jonathan Hoefler|url=http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-27370.html|publisher=McGill University|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Italic type|Italics]] are true italic designs, with flourishes influenced by calligraphy, an unusual feature for geometric slab serif designs. As with many [[Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones]] designs, it was released in a wide range of weights from hairline to bold, reflecting its design goal as a typeface for complex magazines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Typographica review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Earls|first1=David John|title=Archer|url=http://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/archer/|website=Typographica|accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
The typeface has been used for, among other things, branding for [[Wells Fargo]] and is a main font for the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' and [[Wes Anderson]]'s film ''[[The Grand Budapest Hotel]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=Lauren|title=Is Archer's Use on Target?|url=http://www.aiga.org/is-archers-use-on-target/|publisher=AIGI}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the current font used for titles and body text by the [[Design Observer]] website.

===[[Katisha]]===
Contains no information not in [[The Mikado]] article, the point of the spin-off unclear, as the character only appears in one opera, and it's unclear how this could expand further. In normal circumstances I'd say merge or make it a redirect, but, as I said, everything IS covered in [[The Mikado]], and I can't imagine someone searching for &quot;Katisha&quot;.

*'''Delete''' article per nomination.  Anything notable about this character should appear in the plot summary of ''[[The Mikado]]''.  There is no reason to have a separate article for this character.  -- [[User:Ssilvers|Ssilvers]] 19:59, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Redirect''' it to [[The Mikado]] -- merge isn't needed since the info's there, but the redirect could be useful -- somebody could search for it. -- [[User:ArglebargleIV|ArglebargleIV]] 22:15, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

A tag has been placed on [[:Nonamaker]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article seems to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable [[Wikipedia:Notability|(see the guidelines for notability here)]]. If you can indicate why the subject of this article is notable, you may contest the tagging. To do this, please affix the template &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; to the page and leave a note on [[Talk:Nonamaker|the article's talk page]] explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself.

Please read the [[WP:CSD|criteria for speedy deletion]] (specifically, article #7) and [[Wikipedia:Notability (people)|our general biography criteria]].

== Waterboarding ==

Could you post a link where somebody calls [[surfing]] [[waterboarding]]?  I can't seem to find any. [[User:Jehochman|Jehochman]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Jehochman|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:46, 26 April 2009 (UTC)

Yes, Waterboarding is a very common term in Hawaii, the Western US, Australia and even some former Soviet countries. Here's a link to an article where the author references this http://mydailyclarity.com/2009/03/surfing-for-peace-in-the-gaza/. Also, I found a site that references waterboarding here http://www.hawaiiansouthshore.com/shop/product.php?productid=17375. It get's confusing; I was looking for 'surfing' but we call it Waterboarding so I got to the wrong page ;-)

: Fair enough.  That source uses &quot;water boarding&quot; with a space.  I've made a change to your edit to reflect the space. [[User:Jehochman|Jehochman]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Jehochman|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:23, 26 April 2009 (UTC)</text>

I removed &quot;2006 is only his second full season as a team-manager. It took other team managers, such as [[Frank Williams]] many years to win a grand prix as manager.&quot;

This suggests Fry is responsible for a dramatic turnaround in the team's performance - their 2005 and 2006 performances have been widely acknowledged to have been poor to middling. the circumstances of the Hungarian GP were also exceptional. [[User:Mark83|Mark83]] 19:37, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

::It has been reported in the Telegraph (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/motorsport/formulaone/5369856/Monaco-Grand-Prix-Jenson-Buttons-playboy-days-behind-him.html) that Nick Fry owns a proportion of the team, and in an earlier article, that he owns the majority stake. Shouldn't this be added?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/92.239.225.23|92.239.225.23]] ([[User talk:92.239.225.23|talk]]) 23:17, 28 May 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Klein-Glienicke Schweizerhaus 1.jpg|thumb|320px|''Schweizerhaus'' in [[Klein Glienicke]] near [[Berlin]], designed by [[Ferdinand von Arnim]], 1867]]
'''Swiss chalet style''' ({{lang-de|Schweizerstil}}, {{lang-no|Sveitserstil}}) is an [[architectural style]] of [[Historicism (art)|Late Historicism]], originally inspired by rural [[chalet]]s in [[Switzerland]] and the [[Alps|Alpine]] (mountainous) regions of [[Central Europe]]. The style refers to traditional building designs characterised by widely projecting roofs and facades richly decorated with wooden balconies and carved ornaments. It spread over [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Austria-Hungary]] and [[Scandinavia]] during the ''[[Belle Époque]]'' era.

==History==
[[File:Villa Fridheim, Krøderen, 2.jpg|thumb|Villa Fridheim in [[Krødsherad]], Norway]]
Swiss chalet style originated in the [[German Romanticism|Romantic]] era of the late-18th/early-19th century, when the ideas of the [[English landscape garden]] inspired parks and residences in Germany, such as the [[Dessau-Wörlitz Garden Realm]]. It became highly appreciated on the continent by noble landowners who were impressed by the &quot;simple life&quot; of people living in the mountains. 

The chalet style soon spread over the German ''[[Mittelgebirge]]'' landscapes such as the [[Harz]] mountains or the [[Dresden]] area and the adjacent [[North Bohemia]]n region. As a &quot;modern&quot; building style, it also influenced the [[resort architecture]] along the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] seaside, like in [[Binz]] or [[Heringsdorf, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|Heringsdorf]]. Around 1900, design elements were used in the construction of numerous bourgeois family homes as well as by notable architects like [[Heinrich von Ferstel]] to build larger mansions and hotels. 

The style was further popularized by the first waves of tourism of rich people from the North and West of Europe and became popular in other parts of Europe and North America, notably in the [[architecture of Norway]], [[architecture of Iceland|Iceland]] and [[Architecture of the Netherlands|the Netherlands]] and in the [[country house]] architecture of [[architecture of Sweden|Sweden]] and [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati (Ohio, USA)]], in the late 19th and early 20th century. English examples of the chalet style include the [[Boathouse at Belton House]], [[Lincolnshire]], by [[Anthony Salvin]] and the Swiss Cottage at [[Osbourne House]], on the [[Isle of Wight]], constructed for [[Queen Victoria]]'s children.

==Characteristics==
The style is characterized by:
*[[Gabled roof|Gabled roofs]] with wide [[eaves]]
*Exposed construction beams, including large [[Bracket (architecture)|brackets]]
*Decorative carving and mouldings
*[[Balconies]]
*Large windows
*[[Weatherboarding]], usually painted, often in bright colors

The result was '''delete'''. -- [[User:Jitse Niesen|Jitse Niesen]] ([[User talk:Jitse Niesen|talk]]) 12:28, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

:In case anybody requires an explanation how I arrived at this decision, as it is a bit borderline: There seems to be only one reliable source, an article repeated in USA Today and other media. What tipped the balance is firstly the weak reasons in some of the &quot;keep&quot; comments (specifically, those of necronudist, Portillo, and I don't understand Minfo); and secondly, I think we should be extremely cautious in having articles about living children. -- [[User:Jitse Niesen|Jitse Niesen]] ([[User talk:Jitse Niesen|talk]]) 12:45, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

* '''Delete''' - he's ten years old, for crying out loud. If he makes it as a pro then add him in but not until then. [[User:Qwghlm|Qwghlm]] 20:09, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
**'''Comment''' You can't delete or not delete an article purely based on age. --[[User:Pinkkeith|Pinkkeith]] 20:11, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
***'''Comment''' - the point is that he doesn't meet [[WP:BIO]]. There are thousands of kids with potential; they get articles here when that potential is realised by playing for the first team of a significant club. WP is not a crystal ball. [[User:BlueValour|BlueValour]] 20:53, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
****'''Comment''' Well, that wasn't the point that you made, but it does pass [[WP:BIO]] based on [[WP:GOOGLE]]. There is no crystal ball to this article at all, it is all based on present information and known fact. --[[User:Pinkkeith|Pinkkeith]] 21:00, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
*****'''Comment''' What &quot;known fact?&quot;  There is not a single source cited in the entire article.  I am particularly leery of this becoming another AFD where the article is kept because of references cited in the AFD discussion that never make it into the article thus defeating the entire purpose of this discussion and [[WP:V]].  --[[User:ElKevbo|ElKevbo]] 14:26, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
*We can, however, '''delete''' an article if no reliable sources are provided when challenged under [[WP:V|verifiability policy]].  Pinkkeith, can you point us to featured coverage in mainstream media?  Some of those are needed to let us keep the article.  Being signed to a youth team isn't notable enough to get thousands of other kids their own WP articles.  [[User:Barno|Barno]] 20:39, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
** Here is a [http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/technology/maney/2005-02-01-maney_x.htm USA Today article] on him. In there the writer mentions that he was covered in numerous other newspapers. --[[User:Pinkkeith|Pinkkeith]] 20:43, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
*** - fine but he has achieved nothing in the adult world - the press references are the result of a splendid publicity campaign for his video but that doesn't confer notability. [[User:BlueValour|BlueValour]] 20:57, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
**** That's blatent [[ephebiphobia]]. Reread the article, the entire article is talking about the video and how it made him notable. --[[User:Pinkkeith|Pinkkeith]] 21:01, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

[http://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=%22Jean+Carlos+Chera%22&amp;btnG=Search+Archives&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8 Google News Archive] search yields 74 unique hits- more than enough to qualify as &quot;the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person.&quot; How old the subject is and the method in which he was made notable isn't relevant; the subject meets [[WP:BIO]]. --[[User talk:Rory096|Rory096]] 21:14, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
:*'''Comment''' - most of the content, apart from his birthdate, fails [[WP:V]]. The Ghits mean we can keep the article not that we must. They are all the result of a single video being published on the internet and they have all picked up the same story.

[[User:BlueValour|BlueValour]] 16:58, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''-So he's a child prodigy, that doesn't make him notable.  Some of my friends are amazing at basketball, but they don't have any articles.  As above, if he makes it to the pros (or college, if Brazil has a college league, I dunno), then we can always repost.

*'''Delete'''  When he has played for Manchester United, Arsenal, Porto, Eindhoven or Real Madrid he will have earned his article.  Until then it is worth remembering that, at least in the UK, it would be highly improper for professional clubs to express an interest in a 10 year old, let alone to 'openly court' them.

*'''Delete''' I've reviewed some of these news articles. I can read only the English ones, which are basically the same novelty one-shot story, repeated, or something like the USA today story, which is more about how everyone is famous on the Internet than a biographical source for an article.

Many of the users are very bias against the idea of a 7yr old having its own article or the fact that his only a child prodigy, but indeed we have a child prodigy article. Im definately getting a sense of outright bias and a feeling that many of the voters here are americans. [[portillo]]

*'''Comment''' - I think most of the delete (and some of the keep) votes are completely missing the point. Of course this kid isn't a notable footballer. He is however notable as an internet/media phenomenon. Wikipedia has plenty of articles for such people, as an example go look at [[Mahir Çağrı]]. Then at the bottom of his page have a look at the categories he's placed in. When someone comes to Wikipedia and searches for &quot;that kid i saw clips of on TV&quot; or &quot;that kid my mate sent me videos of&quot; and who's name give 35,000 google hits... He should be here! [[User:Alii h|aLii]] 15:20, 6 November 2006 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' per norm. [[User:Minfo|м info]] 23:03, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - I wonder if there is a misunderstanding here? If you are a child prodigy as a piano player you can play the piano. If you are a child prodigy as a mathematician you can do complicated sums in your head. Here, the kid undoubtedly has unusual ball skills but that doesn't make him a footballer. I also don't see him as a 'internet/media phenomenon' with any longevity - with YouTube such phenonima come and go like snow in the sun. [[User:TerriersFan|TerriersFan]] 00:01, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
:He was born as a YouTube phenomen but now he's known by all of the users above, has google entries and BBC articles. Guys, you wanna delete him, let's do it. Simply there are people who search for him and people who know him, there are many articles on paper magazines about him, but if you are too zealous to keep a 9-years-old top-youngster 'cause &quot;well, dear Watson, it fails WP:BIO =_= ahem&quot; let's do it. Do it and stop arguing bullshits. --[[User:Necronudist|necronudist]] 09:24, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

The '''European Federation of [[Financial Analyst]]s Societies''' ('''EFFAS''')[http://www.effas.com] is the federation of [[financial analyst|analysts]] associations in Europe. EFFAS comprises 27 member societies representing more than 14,000 investment professionals. EFFAS was founded in 1962 and the headquarters is located in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]].

Besides its European training programme CEFA (Certified European Financial Analyst) EFFAS also grants the Certified International Investment Analysts (CIIA) designation, ensuring professional qualification by offering global as well as local market knowledge within its examination structure. As a global designation the exams can be taken in different languages. Through the national member societies EFFAS provides a full range of services for capital market experts.

==CIIA Certification==
EFFAS participates in further developing the [[Certified International Investment Analyst]] (CIIA) examinations, a financial analyst designation recognised globally. Analysts who belong to European analyst associations that are members of EFFAS, are eligible to participate in the final CIIA examination, if they pass the foundation and the national exams, or if they hold the Certified European Financial Analyst diploma (CEFA).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Big Andy, (Andrew Walsh) was born in Louisville, Ky., on Feb. 12, 1978.  His father, Frank Walsh and mother, Marsha Sils were overly delighted to have him, since their first son, Patrick, was a dud.  Big Andy was known through his childhood as being pretty funny.  His brother, not so much.  His parents divorced in 1981, after his father recuperated from emergency brain surgery, after falling through the roof at his work and landing head first on the concrete below.  He continued to work there until he passed away after a 3 year battle with melanoma, in 2006, a week before his 54th birthday.  His mom remarried and had another child, a daughter named Brittani (Gamble).</text>

{{Wikipedia subcat guideline|notability criteria|{{PAGENAME}}|[[WP:NMS]]&lt;br&gt;[[WP:SCIENCE]]}}
--&gt;
{{rejected}}

Ideas related to science are an important part of any comprehensive [[WP:ENC|encyclopedia]].  This guideline and its criteria are intended for use in determining whether a topic is notable due to being a part of or related to science.  The tests in this guideline are intended to be fairly rigirous so that a topic that is acceptable under this guideline can be considered an appropriate part of Wikipedia.  However, the failure of a topic to meet this guideline's criteria does not automatically exclude it, as it may attain notability through [[WP:N]] itself or another of its subsidiary guidelines.

==Notability of topics related to science==

The need for this guideline comes from there being a set of topics which do not fail the test of the [[Wikipedia:No original research|No original research]] policy or the [[Wikipedia:Attribution]] policy but which none the less are not appropriate to Wikipedia because they do have sufficient notability.  Such topics mostly represent new findings and theories, as well as past findings and theories that have failed to gain significant attention in either scientific circles or the public at large (or so far failed to gain said attention).

A key element to understanding this guideline is that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a research publication, and as such Wikipedia does not usurp the usual validation processes of scientific institutions such as [[peer review]], [[scientific consensus]], and academic recognition. Decisions about including or excluding material must always reflect the opinions of outside authorities, not those of Wikipedia editors. Inclusion or exclusion is therefore not a judgement on the validity, importance or accuracy of a scientific contribution, but simply a reflection of the quality and quantity of responses it received inside and outside the [[scientific community]].

This [[WP:N|notability guideline]] derives its relevance from the policies [[WP:NOT|What Wikipedia is not]] (in particular [[WP:NOT#IINFO|Not an indiscriminate collection of information]] and [[WP:NOT#CRYSTALBALL|Not a crystal ball]]), [[WP:NOR|No original research]] and [[WP:NPOV|Neutral point of view]] (in particular [[WP:NPOV#Undue weight|Undue weight]] and [[Wikipedia:Neutral point  of view/FAQ#Pseudoscience|Pseudoscience]]), as well as the guidelines [[Wikipedia:Conflict of interest|Conflict of interest]] and [[WP:AUTO|Autobiography]]. Also of importance are [[WP:V|verifiability]] and [[WP:RS|reliability]] policies.

==Criteria==
=== General ===
In general, a contribution in the field of science is notable enough to merit inclusion in Wikipedia if it meets at least one of the following criteria:

#'''Textbook science.''' There is regular non-incidental mention of the contribution in general or specialized textbooks published by reputable presses.{{ref|1|1}}
#'''Widely cited.''' Papers covering the contribution have been widely cited{{ref|2|2}} in its research field{{ref|3|3}} relative to other papers in the same area. Self-citations, and citations in journals which are not respected within the relevant research field should be excluded.
#'''Press and fiction.''' It is or was well known due to extensive press coverage, or due to being a recurrent theme in notable works of [[fiction]]. In this case the article should make note of this status. A single article on the theory, even if from a major media source such as ''[[New Scientist]]'' or ''[[Scientific American]]'', is not a sufficient criterion.
#'''Historical interest.''' It has historically met any of the above criteria within the scientific community or the culture at large but has since either been [[superseded scientific theory|superseded]], disregarded, or dismissed by the scientific community or the culture at large. The article should make note of the subject's status in this regard.
#'''Popular belief.''' It is or was believed to be true by a significant part of the general population, even if rejected by scientific authorities.

Notable topics which are primarily non-scientific in nature but which contain claims concerning scientific phenomena, should not be handled as scientific.  For example, the ''[[Book of Genesis]]'' itself is primarily covered as a religious scripture rather than as a cosmology. On the other hand, subjects such as [[creationism]] or [[creation science]], which involve a direct conflict between scientific and religious doctrine, are properly evaluated both on a scientific and theological basis. Similarly, subjects purporting to have a scientific basis may be noteworthy primarily on cultural or sociological bases, such as UFOs, which can usefully be discussed from several different perspectives.

:{{Seealso|Wikipedia:Notability (science)/Irrelevant arguments}}

===Scientific terms===
:''See also [[Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms]]
A scientific term is considered notable and worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia if the following can be established:
# A commonly agreed-upon formal or informal definition
# A trajectory of use for the term in the scientific literature from [[WP:RS|reliable]] and [[WP:V|verifiable]] sources
To determine notability it is important to keep in mind that different fields sometimes use the same term to describe different concepts. On the other hand, especially in the early stages of a field, terminology is often not standardized and different terms are used for the same concept. The policy on [[WP:NAME|naming conventions]] gives more information on the choice of the proper term when more than one term is used in the scientific literature.

== Assessing the reliability and relevance of sources ==

Journals from which citations and evidence of notability are obtained are expected to be well known and respected within the relevant research field.  The previous requirement of citation from a peer-reviewed source is not alone sufficient by this requirement.  (Peer review is done just as easily by a fringe science journal as by a leading journal, while [[Nature (journal)|Nature magazine]], one of the most respected [[scientific journals]] in existence, uses editorial as well as  peer review for submissions.)

Textbooks should either be well-known and respected or produced by a reputable scientific publisher (which is most likely the same publisher as one or more respected journals).

Journals from scientific societies of developing countries are occasionally not reliable.  If a finding in such a journal should prove to be of great scientific interest, that finding is often reprinted and/or reported in reliable scientific sources.  In such a case, the original journal article can be cited as a primary source, but its relevance should be backed up by secondary citations in known reliable sources.

For biographical articles and articles on fringe science, there is some loosening of these requirements.  Works by the topic of a biographical article are relevant to the article whether their writing was published in a reliable journal/publisher or not.  Also, the contents of a journal devoted to a fringe science can provide evidence as to the past or current thinking within that fringe field.  However, the fringe science journals cannot provide evidence for the outright notability of the topic.

==Notes==
{{note|1|Note 1}}:  The scientific contribution must have a major entry in the work. A passing mention of the concept is not sufficient. 

{{note|2|Note 2}}:  Citation counts and peer review mechanisms differ vastly between sciences, fields, and subfields, and editors are urged to inform the relevant [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Council/Directory/Science|WikiProject]] about ongoing debates to get expert input. It should also be noted that ''quantity'' of citations is often only a poor approximation of ''quality''.

{{note|3|Note 3}}:  A &quot;research field&quot; indicates an established area of study for which the topic in question is only a part.  A topic cannot be its own research field, nor can it gain notability from being part of a field which is non-notable.

__NOTOC__
===Overview===
After much deliberation of the [[Wikipedia:Danny's contest/Contest entries|contest entries]] the judges have arrived at a decision.

The entries could be broken down into three broad groups... entries that didn't seem to have much, if any, improvement, entries that were a &quot;good try&quot; and a handful of entries that really took the contest to heart and added a lot of interesting and germane references.

===Criteria===
The judges graded on 4 major criteria:
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!Criterion
!Description
!Weight
|-
|'''Number of citations'''
|Just a  raw count of how many were added. This was a good filter to see if the article could make the finalists... only 2 or 3 refs suggested that maybe not so much had been done.  
|(20%)
|-
|'''Complexity of citations'''
|A gauge of the difficulty level of adding them. Were they notes? web cites? book cites? did they use ISBN tagging? were there multiple places that got the same note? Notes ON notes? 
|(30%)
|-
|'''Appropriateness of cites'''
|Were they actually GOOD cites that moved the article forward?
|(20%)  
|-
|'''Overall article improvement'''

|'''[[Battle of Ceresole]]'''
|An important battle in medieval history, part of the [[Italian Wars]] series. Characterised by contemporaries as &quot;marvellously confused&quot; this battle is attractively illustrated with lots of maps and diagrams. One would expect Kyrill as coordinator of [[WP:MILHIST]] to do a good job of improving an article, and Kyrill does not disappoint. A very powerful article about an interesting battle.

|'''[[Theramenes]]'''
|An important general and historical figure of ancient Greece, including participating in an Athenian coup, multiple battles, and a rebellion. He even had notoriety after death. The article is challenging due to a paucity of sources, but Robth found 80+ cites. There also is an innovative organisation of sources into modern and ancient. A very good article based on some painstaking research.

|'''[[Crawford expedition]]'''
|A very understudied but important battle in the [[American Revolution]]. The winning side often tends to ignore battles they lost, and this article was not much more than a single paragraph stub when Kevin went to town on it. It is now profusely illustrated with maps, paintings, tables and diagrams and has grown to 43 Kb. In addition to 88 high quality footnotes, it also has a comprehensive &quot;references&quot; and &quot;for further reading&quot; section, properly separated out. All books have good ISBN links. This article is a real tour de force and shows the power of our encyclopedia well.

That all of these articles were somehow military related was surely coincidence! :)

'''Joe Eubanks''' (born 1975) is an [[United States|American]] [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] best known by the [[ring name]] '''Lobo'''. He wrestled primarily in [[Combat Zone Wrestling]] (CZW), where he won every major championship and was the first inductee into the [[CZW Hall of Fame]] in 2004. He was formerly the CZW Commissioner/Talent Coordinator.&lt;ref name=&quot;Online World of Wrestling&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/040207.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling 5th Anniversary Show February 7, 2004 - Philadelphia, Pennsylvania - ECW Arena|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===1999-2002===
Along with [[Nick Gage]], [[Justice Pain]], and [[Ric Blade]], Lobo was trained by [[John Zandig]] at the CZW Wrestling School and graduated first in the class.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freewebs.com/andy_czw1/history.html CZWHookup : The history of CZW] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210134119/http://www.freewebs.com/andy_czw1/history.html |date=2008-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He became one of the main wrestlers in CZW along with other graduates from the school. In February 1999, Lobo became the second [[CZW Iron Man Championship|Iron Man Champion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Online World of Wrestling&quot;/&gt; He held the title until June when he lost it to Justice Pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/990619.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling - CZW Down in Flames June 19, 1999 - Mantua, NJ |accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two continued wrestling each other and competed in the first ever Cage of Death match at the first ''Cage of Death'' show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/991016.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling - CZW Cage of Death October 16, 1999 - Mantua, NJ|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lobo won the match and regained the title. He would lose this title to [[Matt Prince|Wifebeater]], but regain it one more time the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/000311.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling - CZW March Violence March 11, 2000 - Sewell, NJ|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lobo also challenged for the [[CZW World Heavyweight Championship|CZW Heavyweight Championship]]. He feuded with Zandig for the title and finally beat him in July 2000. He held the title until ''Cage of Death II''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/000909.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling - CZW Cage of Death II....After Dark September 9, 2000 - Sewell, NJ|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that show, Lobo successfully defended the championship against Zandig in the Cage of Death match. Directly following this match, Justice Pain came out and fought Lobo in another Cage of Death match. In the match, Lobo was thrown from the top of the cage to the ground through a table covered in barbed wire. Justice Pain went on to win the match and the title.&lt;ref name=&quot;Online World of Wrestling&quot;/&gt;  After losing the title, Lobo continued feuding with Zandig. This time, the feud was for ownership of CZW. On February 9, 2002, Lobo defeated Zandig to become the new owner of CZW. He held this position until ''Cage of Death IV'' when Zandig defeated him to regain his position as CZW's owner &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/021213.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling December 13, 2002 - Philadelphia, PA - Viking Hall|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2003-present===
He took some time off from CZW following the Cage of Death match. While he was gone, a new group called the Hi-V tried to take over CZW, with Zandig as their main target. Zandig was planning to face the Hi-V at ''Cage of Death V'', but the stable outnumbered his team 6 to 4. At ''Night of Infamy II'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/031115.html|title=Night of Infamy II - November 15, 2003 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lobo made a shocking return to help Zandig and join his team just in time for Cage of Death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/031213.html|title=Cage of Death V December 13, 2003 - Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their team was successful. In February 2004, Lobo became the first inductee to the CZW Hall of Fame. After this, Lobo remained inactive for the following two years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Online World of Wrestling&quot;/&gt;

At [[Cage of Death 7]], [[Zandig]], who had turned on the fans, wanted to run CZW the way they used to. He called out Lobo, who was backstage for the event, and they joined each other along with [[Justice Pain]] and [[Nick Gage]]. They would later call themselves the Forefathers of CZW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/_2006/|title=2006 results

*'''Speedy Delete''' - for blatant advertising.  I waited a bit to see how this one would play out before making a decision, but as much good faith as I normally assume, there is no sticking up for this one.  The article's [[User:Kobius|prime editor]] (and incidentally, the forum admin) removed the AfD tag from the page and does not take kindly to other editors touching 'his' page.  The whole layout of the article is clearly trying to draw viewers into the forums, perhaps to meet the admitted goal of 500,000 posts.  Add these to the issues others have pointed out and there's really no need for further discussion.

The Anizone is a large site and I think if someone wants to find out more about it they come to the best internet dictionary in the world and they research on of the largest best sites. The site has a largely amount of fair people considering it has been hacked three times. The admin accidently remoe it thinking it would be delete and he was not the maker of the page but it was I.

==BBC News Report and the pilot &quot;looking for a good place to crash&quot;==

The BBC article states that the pilot was looking for a good place to put the aircraft down; he missed some park and instead put the aircraft down in an uninhabited area near Stockport city centre. The evidence does not justify this supposition whatsoever. For one thing, the AIB report states that the aircraft was likely uncontrollable after the engines cut out, and might not have been controllable even before then. The first officer died and the captain suffered retrograde amnesia, so we don't know what went on in the cockpit. There isn't the tiniest shred of evidence that the pilot &quot;put the aircraft down&quot; someplace safe. It was likely just coincidence - there are a lot of empty or disused areas around airports and under approach paths (and *that* is often deliberate).

This is such a common urban legend/media foofah. Every time a plane doesn't actually fall out of the sky, some media type comes up and says the pilot was &quot;looking for a place to crash that wouldn't cause injuries on the ground&quot;. I don't blame the Wikipedian who put this in at all, because he/she likely didn't have any sources other than the BBC article. I am blaming the BBC for making a supposition not supported by the facts.

I suppose people want to think that in an emergency the first thing the pilot will do is look for a safe place to crash. It makes them feel less worried about an aircraft crashing into their home, school, or place of business. It ain't necessarily so, though; in fact it almost is never so. Aircraft about to crash are more often than not uncontrollable - that's why they crash. --[[User:Charlene.fic|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot; face=&quot;Matisse ITC&quot;&gt;Charlene&lt;/font&gt;]] 19:40, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

Edited to add: The cause of the accident wasn't &quot;pump failure&quot; (boo, BBC, again). It was a design error in the fuel line. --[[User:Charlene.fic|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot; face=&quot;Matisse ITC&quot;&gt;Charlene&lt;/font&gt;]] 20:02, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

:Apologies. That would have been my factual faux pas. Thank you for correcting my blathering and making this article respectable. :) [[User:Legion89|Legion]] 13:56, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

A second's more flight and the plane would catastrophically have taken the tower off Stockport's fine Town Hall and crashed into the facade of the (then) infirmary opposite the Town Hall, blocking the main road between that runs from Manchester through Stockport to the south - AG, Stockport.

== Additional cause of this crash ==

I remember seeing a BBC program about this crash. It reported on the findings of the inquiry. It said that there was an additional reason for the crash.

Apparently, the engine speeds were shown in the cockpit on two dials, one for each wing. Each dial had two hands, one for each engine and each labelled with the engine number.

This had been serviced, and a mistake had been made so that engine 3 was connected to the hand marked &quot;4&quot;, and engine 4 to hand &quot;3&quot;.

I think it was engine 4 that was starved of fuel. The pilot saw from the dial that engine 3 had stopped, so he switched off / feathered engine 3. Now both engines on the right wing were out. (This would explain why engine 4 was windmilling.)

As part of the investigation, they tried flying a similar aircraft with engines 3 and 4 both out, and discovered that the aircraft could not be flown properly.

Now, I mention all this because it is an interesting story. Also, because I want to apply the moral to setting up a computer cluster. I want to avoid the possibility of one computer failing and a different one being taken out for service by mistake, thereby bringing down the cluster. 

Does anyone know more about this? [[User:Mm67|Mm67]] 11:44, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

==Is [[Wikipedia:Notability (science)]] a consensus guideline?==
Please state your position, '''yes''' or '''no''', explain your position and defend it.  This is not a vote.  [[User:SmokeyJoe|SmokeyJoe]] 10:47, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Yes''' I consider it one, and I'm not sure what objection people have - if there's a problem that needs fixing, let's fix it.  I already refer to it, guideline or not, since it's very useful.  --[[User:Minderbinder|Minderbinder]] 12:38, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Yes''' Not only is it a consensus guideline, it is absolutely vital for Wikipedia to have such a guideline. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 12:51, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Yes''' I certainly support this guideline, what it is trying to do, and how it is trying to achieve it. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:10, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Yes''' We're ready to go into the stage where changes should be discussed here before being implemented in the policy page. ~ [[User:Trialsanderrors|trialsanderrors]] 17:40, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Absolutely''' We've numerous AfDs and arbcom cases which have documented that this is the community's intent. --[[User:EngineerScotty|EngineerScotty]] 17:44, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* I don't see where the proposed criteria add meaningful advice to writters or evaluators, and the preamble/text is way too long to be practical.  Please cite some examples of AfD where this proposal would have ensured an outcome other than what would have been achieved under the current guidelines.  For each of the criteria now listed I belive that proper application of WP:N and WP:ATT would acheive the same results.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 17:54, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
** There is [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Electric universe (concept)]], where this standard helped to refine the arguments that finally got the topic removed.  The aupporters trying to use this guideline to buoy their cause ended up only showing all the more that the article did not belong in Wikipedia.  &lt;br&gt;You are correct that in the end articles that are removed will be so removed (or not) due to policy concerns.  The need for this guideline comes from its ability to focus the debate on the issues that are important in the relevant cases.  In other words, it helps to achieve the &quot;proper application&quot; that you are claiming makes this guideline irrelevant. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 18:22, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
*** EMS, could your purpose be acheived with an essay?  Among the problems with permutations from guidelines and policies is the evolution into redundant and conficting guidance to the point that writers and evaluators become confused and the branches work at cross purposes.  My frequent analogy is the US Tax Code, which has bread several large industries for interpretation and application.  Writing complex rule sets requires great skill and caution. --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 18:34, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
*** On review of the Electric universe (concept) AfD, it appears to be resoundingly rejected with the tools we already have, most convincingly original research and few reliable sources.  This outcome is consistent with other scientific and academic issues which I have seen defeated at AfD. An excellent nomination doesn't hurt either! --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 18:42, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
**** Right now I am wondering what your agenda is here, as this type of opposition usually comes from someone who has lost an AfD in part due to this and the guidelines and is seeking to water down the standards.  One of the factors that helped with the electric universe AfD was the the nominator was also working on this guideline and used its insights in writing the nom.  Beyond that, there is the basic issue of moving beyond &quot;peer review&quot; as a standard for inclusion, a test passed by numerous non-notable articles that I have seen.  Also, I at least have gone to some pains to couch this as a setting standard for inclusions instead of exclusion.  That way, an argument that &quot;X calls for inclusion&quot; renders this guideline moot as a refutation, and so avoids the types of conflicts that in our laws make being a lawyer such a profitable profession. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 19:16, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
***** My agenda is not as you assert, but your question is a fair one, which I will answer.  My agenda is clarity in the grand scheme of notability guidelines, without a specific prejudice to this proposal. Please visit the discussion page for WP:N to see that there are many people expressing concerns over the whole process.  I support the concept of &quot;encyclopedic suitability&quot;, which we call notablility at WP, for lack of a better name.  I also consider myself a moderate inclusionist.  I am a frequent participant in Afd.  You are correct in one respect, that I origninally became involved in AfD and notability, because I saw too many abuses by uninformed editors who were deleting meanigful articles, though not specifically in the field of science.  My interest is in history and sailing.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 19:33, 16 March 2007 (UTC) 
******Might I recommend that your &quot;no&quot; comment seems to be motivated more by a general dislike for [[WP:N]] rather than a specific distaste for this particular guideline. In particular, the motivation behind this guideline was in part due to a charge made during the [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Pseudoscience|Pseudoscience arbitrartion case]] that such a guideline should exist to fend off charges related to whether an idea was notable in a scientific sense. One can argue whether [[WP:N]] should exist or not, but that's not for us to decide here. It is absolutely not true that this guideline is redudant: there is no other place where it is indicated what makes a scientific idea notable for inclusion in the encyclopedia. [[WP:NOR]] doesn't help because &quot;originality&quot; is a vague concept related to heavily to [[WP:V]] and [[WP:COI]] to be useful when people just make random articles about ostensibly scientific subjects they read about online, for example. [[WP:A]] doesn't help because there are scientific ideas which are not notable (the general consensus of the community is that they do not belong in the encyclopedia) which nevertheless are attributable to reliable sources. [[WP:NPOV]] doesn't work because the exclusion criteria at [[WP:NPOV#Undue weight]] is unable to distinguish between majority and minority except by [[WP:CON|consensus]]. That's why this guideline is needed and why it is used. Look at all the pages that link here and tell me that it isn't referred to. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 13:09, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
* No, it's not.  I think the burden of some evidence that this guideline is widely supported and necessary needs to be shown from the supporters.  Right now it's an initiative, a proposal with stable wording.  However, even in the &quot;test cases&quot; that I looked at, it seems that this guideline isn't being referred to, and evaluation of the articles in question isn't done with these guidelines in mind, rather, articles are mainly evaluated from a point of view of adequate sourcing and original research issues, in other words, policies we already have.  (I do think the editors here have reached a reasonably stable consensus, though.  But that doesn't, to me, make a &quot;consensus guideline,&quot; which implies support from the community overall.)[[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:04, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
**The evidence is in the ''What links here'' tool you can access from the toolbox. I think that you may have a hidden agenda here: you tend to be a bit too quick to agree to a supression bias against non-experts in the fields of science. Is this a misplaced concern? --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 13:09, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
***First of all there are over 150 things that link to [[Wikipedia:Notability (science)]], so it's not unreasonable to expect evidence to be actually gathered by someone trying to make a case.  But more, I went to a few of those &quot;what links here&quot; and apparently the only reason they were linked was that trialsanderrors mentioned that the debate was a test case: not people actually referring to the guideline and trying to use it.  Look at the Electric Universe AfD, for instance, which is the best example I've seen of a borderline-notable scientific theory (where this guideline might help).  [[WP:SCIENCE]] was not used as an argument in the debate, even by you, and the arguments that led to it being deleted were not even much along the lines of what is presented here in the guideline, but were according to core Wikipedia policies like [[WP:ATT]], [[WP:OR]] and so on.  Some of the argument is covered here in the introduction, but the &quot;criteria&quot; part played no role and seems to be central to this as a notability guideline.  So, this is what I mean when I say that no evidence has been presented.  What do YOU mean when you say this is a consensus guideline?  [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:43, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
****The criteria part played a huge role. The only criteria that EU could have come close to satisfying was recognition in popular culture/outside media and we showed that it was not notable along those lines. The guidelines at the time were being formulated and weren't as clear as they are now, but thanks to discussions such as that AfD we have a clearer demarcation. I think you need to read through the AfD we reference again and look carefully at how the criteria line-up with the criteria outlined in this guideline. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:02, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
*****Could you show me precisely where?  I don't mean to be dense, but I really don't see it.  I see your point #5 in the nomination, but that sounds like the core [[WP:N]] argument, and not related to the criteria here.  And anyway, saying the the EU debate influenced [[WP:SCIENCE]] kind of precludes that the EU debate can be thought of as evidence that this is a consensus guideline.  Can you show me ANY AfD debate that explicitly references the criteria?  [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:17, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
******Number 5 in the nomination. While it doesn't explicitly reference this page, it does so implicitly (and if I recall correctly at the time the standards were still being developed as to which criteria were going to be grouped with which). --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:20, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
*******Again, #5 was really along the lines of basic [[WP:N]].  Again, show me any debates that explicitly reference the criteria.  There's a difference between this proposal being wise or balanced or sensible and it having ''broad community support.''  [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:44, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
********Basic [[WP:N]]&quot;? That's a bit of WikiLawyering I haven't come across before. The fact is that #5 has direct parallels to our criteria here. You can thrust your head in the sand over this all you want, but that's the plain truth of the matter. And now you reposition your attack to claim that there isn't &quot;broad community support&quot;, but let me remind you that arbcomm members entreatied the community to develop these standards in the first place and that by virtue of this being a Wiki it will end up as balanced and sensible as possible. I'm beginning to think you are being a stick-in-the-mud for reasons you aren't coming clean about. Help me out, explain to me why you always seem to be fighting against scientific accuracy at Wikipedia so I can [[WP:AGF|assume good faith]] towards your contributions. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 17:36, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
***I suggest you go read [[WP:AGF]] and actually take it to heart.  In our current discussion, you seem to have trouble differentiating between (1) my personal support or opposition of the proposal and (2) my arguing that the proposal isn't a &quot;consensus guideline&quot;, that is, that it doesn't have broad support.  This wouldn't be a very hard difference to understand if you had been assuming good faith of me in the first place.  For the record, I support some of what the proposal says but not all of it, but that wasn't the basis for my objections: calling the proposal a &quot;consensus guideline&quot; is wrong, because this is still a very new proposal, barely even stable enough to judge.  [[WP:PROF]] remained a proposal for a very long time, and finally became a guideline when it became apparent that the guideline had influenced the way decisions were being made, and that the community, de facto, embraced the guideline.  Creation of policies and guidelines is slow and for good reason, especially when actionable changes are being proposed (like the criteria here).

****I appreciate your candor regarding your opinions of the content of this guideline because that is precisely what concerns me. However, I do feel that you are being a bit oblique in your commentary. &quot;Policy creation is slow,&quot; is often the cry of those who want to slow things down, and people tend to drag their feet for a reason. To me and many of the other editors who commented above, this guideline is ''de facto'' in place and isn't a proposal because we as editors abide by it. As you know, Wikipedia policies and guidelines are not written to affect change in the encyclopedia, but rather are meant to describe what actively goes on in editing. A good number of those who say that this is a consensus guideline edit a lot of science-related articles and so should be the ones to tell whether or not this guideline applies. I don't see that you are actively doing this as such. I do see you stepping into disputes regarding science-related articles often, and there are many times I see these actions as being in something of a contravention of the guidelines outlined here. I am being very up-front about my distrust of your motivations, but in so doing I'm also trying to assume good-faith as much as I can. Part of assuming good-faith is being transparent about one's perceptions and I'm offering you the opportunity to explain yourself as transparently as possible so we can move on. I don't like being lectured about [[WP:AGF]] when I was the one who brought it up, it looks to me like you are asking me to turn a blind eye towards our long history here at the encyclopedia and I am honestly telling you I'm having a hard time doing it because of the nature of this particular dispute we're having. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 13:53, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
*****You are making false implications about me, and I want it to stop.  [[WP:CIV|Comment on my comments]].  You say this is an attempt to document how Wikipedia works?  I respectfully disagree -- this talk page and its archives are full of debates about what the criteria ''should'' be, with very little discussion or analysis of how things are actually decided now.  (Some, but not much.)  From perusing the test cases, it seems to me that people are nearly exclusively deciding on these cases on the basis of [[WP:OR]], [[WP:ATT]], and [[WP:NPOV]], (and to a degree, [[WP:N]]), without much need for arguments specific to issue that the topics under discussion are scientific ones.  Since that ''isn't'' the content of this proposal, I cannot agree that this is documenting current Wikipedia practice, but if you want to try to change my mind, please show me specific examples so we can discuss them.  In any case, you should advertise this debate on [[WP:VPR]]; the general Wikipedia community should have a chance to comment.

******Whether they are false or not, they are simply my questions regarding your, frankly, obstinate resistance to this particular document. I am trying to be as forthright as possible here, and your increasingly haughty responses only confuse me further since you still haven't addressed directly my concerns regarding the history we have surrounding issues such as this. I disagree that the discussions are centering around how things &quot;should&quot; be. Rather I see discussions centering around generalizing from the experience that editors have. You also seem to be under the opinion that just because people reference older and more established policies and guidelines they aren't also considering this guideline. This I find to be particularly problematic because it ignores the words of people that aren't appended with a WP-acronym. Just because somebody doesn't cite this directly doesn't mean that you can't see the criteria being applied (as per our earlier discussion on EU deletion). I would hope that you would look more closely at the deletion discussions surrounding this and see if you can't spot the criteria in action. I am not going to advertise the debate anywhere, but you are free to do so. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 16:27, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
*******I've advertised the debate at [[WP:VPR]].  In terms of the status: you see one thing, I see another thing.  I'm not going to change my opinion by simply being told &quot;please look more closely,&quot; although you could convince me if you actually showed me some evidence.  I do see a lot of attempts at guiding the community: take a look at [[#&quot;Conference topic&quot; is a backdoor]], for instance, or [[#One final thought]]: people are discussing how to make a good rule, not what the rule is, organically.

****I'm with SA here: [[WP:N]] is being criticized partly because of its extreme generality.  No reason to think the entire idea of notability for all topics must pause just because of that.

****  The problem lies less with any individual sub-guideline, but more with a plethora of permutations leading to confusion.

***** I don't see any bedlam here.  I see this as being a well crafted guideline that is dealing with issues which are out-of-scope for the more general guideline due to its broad nature.  This guideline deals with the issues of science and science-related topics, and how to implement the notability guidelines within that context.&lt;br&gt;I have looked at the [[WP:N]] discussion and I get the feeling that you are doing your best to create uncertainty and confusion there.  And now you are trying to do the same here.  I for one have no need for it, and support this guideline as a reflection of the legitimate sense of the science editors here as to what is valid. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 18:23, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
*Yes, this appears to be a consensus guideline. The opposition to this guideline proposal may be part of a campaign in which User:Kevin Murray in the past month has placed &quot;rejected&quot; , &quot;disputed&quot; , or &quot;historical&quot; , or &quot;essay&quot; labels on about a dozen notability proposals or guidelines or has nominated them for deletion on the grounds that there was no consensus or that they constituted &quot;instruction creep&quot; or were redundant. A proposal is not necessarily impossible to reach consensus upon just because a few editors oppose it.

** I see your point.  This editor really, really has a grudge against the concept of notability, and I would love to know why.  If you want to do a [[WP:RfC]] against him, I am will be happy to second it.  This is ridiculous. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 19:42, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
*** No EMS, this editor, has a &quot;grudge&quot; against needless and redundant rule making for the sake of rule making.  I strongly support the concept of encyclopedic suitability which we call &quot;notability&quot; at WP.  This is not &quot;ridiculous&quot; but based on observations from life experience, that too many conficting rules create confusion rather than clarity.  Complex rule-sets require incredible cross coordination among the permutations, which is not happening here at WP, as guidelines are multiplying like rabbits without consideration of the big picture.  If you propose an RfC, please do so in the best interest of WP, not &quot;against&quot; me; this is not personal and reviewing the discussions will reveal that my actions are well supported.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 14:18, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
****There are plenty of Wikipedians who [[WP:IAR|agree with you about hating rules]]. However, might I suggest that you are going about it the wrong way. We are here writing this guideline because we need to summarize what has been done in regards to this issue. Your own personal distaste for the way in which editors have gone about doing this is probably best argued elsewhere: it certainly has nothing to do with whether consensus exists for this particular guideline. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:29, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
*** I do not see '''any''' need to coordinate this guideline with any other guidelines beside [[WP:N]] itself.  Although I am doing my own &quot;[[WP:NOR|original research]]&quot;, I have seem enough -uh- &quot;stuff&quot; offered by others such that I see a need to draw a firm and reasonable as to what is and is not acceptable here.  Until it has some reasonable amount of recognition in the scientific community, I see an article on my ideas as being an abuse of Wikipedia.  Yet I am unusual in that most other editors of Wikipedia with alternate ideas are here to promote those ideas, and they hate guidelines like this one with a purple passion because they help to keep their OR out.&lt;br&gt;BTW - I do see where you have had some success with you anti-Notability campaign.  Personally I think that you are doing Wikipedia a real disservice with it, and what you are stifling is not a bunch useless rule-making but instead needed elaborations on the meaning of Notability in various domains.  As has been noted in [[Wikipedia_talk:Notability|the WP:N discussion]], there is a level of subjectiveness in determining notability.  The need for these subsidary guidelines is to limit that subjectiveness, and thereby make this concept more usable.  Instead you are trying to pull the rug out from under Notability, something that will make the removal of questionable material much more difficult than it should be. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 16:08, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''the real test''' is whether the guidelines here will be accepted in practice. Both the above positions are to some degree correct: the guideline should reflect what its eds. believe to be the common feeling of the community, but it shouldalso point in the direction of where the consensus appears to be moving, and to be making recommendations from those most involved in edited these articles to guide thos less familiar. I think it will prove to be accepted because it is relatively straightforward, not complex -- at least by comparison -- and, in my view it does reflect the general voice. But we shall see. 
::The real dispute , I think, is over the notability of fringe science and whether that can be considered science in any sense at all. This is a matter in which I think there is in fact no real consensus, but at best a temporary majority, and i expect this  question to continue to be the theme of AfDs. I don't think this guideline  lays it to rest '''[[User:DGG|DGG]]''' 23:36, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
::: This guideline cannot and should not judge whether something is &quot;real science&quot;.  In fact, all that a determination that something is &quot;not science&quot; can do here is to remove a topic from being judged by this criteria with no resolution on its notability or lack thereof.  IMO, we have a set of criteria here such that anything that is meant to be judged as part of science can be ruled on here, be it mainstream or fringe.  What I think that you will find is that the least palatable topics are those which also have had the least impact and are also therefore the least notable.  --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 01:53, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

== Some suggestions on organizing this project page ==

* The introduction is too long.  Limit it to &quot;what&quot; and &quot;why&quot;.  Get the commentary (i.e. &quot;impetus&quot;) and discussion of process into its own section.  Specifically address what makes ''science'' different from other areas covered by the general guidelines.
* Criteria should define at least these categories as guidance to editors:
** topics which on their face should be include (i.e. the notable)
** topics which are going to require some judgments to be made by editors if they are new articles or added to existing articles. (i.e. the maybe notable)
** topics which, at least according to the authors of the guideline, are ''improbably'' included. (i.e. nonnotable)
* The statement ''&quot;Decisions about including or excluding material must always reflect the opinions of outside authorities, not those of Wikipedia editors.&quot;'' is bizarre because the opinion of Wikipedia editors is what, by definition, compose the Wikipedia. ''&quot;Must always&quot;'' is a rather strange term to be found in a mere ''guideline'' at any rate. [[User:Patsw|patsw]] 13:22, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

:: If you wish to draft an alternate version, the feel free to do so ''elsewhere'' and present it to us as a possible replacement.  We are certainly amenable to productive changes.  However, IMO the current project page works and should be considered a functioning guideline. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:13, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
:I agree the ''reflect outside authorities'' wording is odd (although not any odder than &quot;notability is not subjective&quot; which expresses the [[WP:ATT|same sentiment]]). The rest doesn't strike me as an improvement. ~ [[User:Trialsanderrors|trialsanderrors]] 17:49, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

::One point that isn't being made (in the intro) and probably should be is the point that scientific theories cannot be properly presented without understanding their level of acceptance.  There's a big difference between a mainstream theory and a fringe theory, and even in an article about a fringe theory, it's important to describe it as one.  However, for some fringe theories, insufficient sources exist to back up the claim that they are fringe theories.  Thus we are left with only one real choice: disallow the article, as we cannot properly cover it while adhering to [[WP:ATT]] and [[WP:NPOV]].  This is different from, say, an article about a band, where it may be that no source reports on their popularity or number of fans accurately, but sources do report on other things: the information we can't cover can just be left out.  In articles on science, we really can't leave that out.  [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:41, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

:::The &quot;level of acceptance&quot; argument makes no sense to me. &quot;Theory&quot; in science has a very precise meaning which applies to models and descriptions which are as completely accepted as possible in an endeavor based primarily on the dubious activity of inductive reasoning. While there is a big difference between mainstream and fringe proposals, the proposals themselves are only considered &quot;theories&quot; when they pass the tests of the scientific method. What makes a proposal fringe is, ostensibly, its inability to pass these tests. This doesn't mean that scientists don't make mistakes in pejoratively labeling the fringe out of the mainstream, only to say that the level of acceptance is something of a binary operator: either it's in or it's out. When an idea does not generate enough interest in the scientific community to create commentary from members of the community, it must either be uncontroversial (as is the case with textbook knowledge) or it must be outside the scientific community. This is quite easy to verify. No amount of posturing and insisting on the part of a fringe idea's proponents that the idea is actually &quot;scientific&quot; is good enough when demarcating for our purposes. We might still have articles on the idea if there is &quot;extra-scientific&quot; interest in it, but we do not need to shy away from being honest about its &quot;extra-scientific&quot; nature. One of the problems that many pro-fringe editors have is that they believe that because [[negative proof|proving the negative]] is in principle a defiance of [[WP:ATT]] that reasonable editors can't make editorial judgments with regards to the status of a particular idea. This is simply not the case at all: we are editing an encyclopedia not compiling a list of sources. After all, that's why we have editors in the first place: we are charged with summarizing the available data in the most conformist way possible. When all the data is outside the scientific community and the idea purports to have scientific importance, it is perfectly fine to delineate the contradiction. However, this discussion is probably better suited for [[WP:FRINGE]]. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:09, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

*I think it is a little more complicated than that.
*It is not ''necessary'' to give an indication of the acceptance of a theory, in order to describe it.
*And I don't think the word &quot;theory&quot; has such a precise meaning as scientists would like. For example, Wikipedia calls the [[Big Bang]] a &quot;theory&quot;, whereas the Encyclopedia Britannic calls it a &quot;Model&quot;. And I am sure there are more sources supporting both.
*This is why the new [[WP:A]] is so important. I can attribute both the Big Bang Theory, and the Big Bang Model, but I can find no source which agues it must be one or the other.
*I can also find no attribution labelling many minority subjects as &quot;fringe&quot;, nor claiming a certain level of acceptance. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 17:47, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

== Making this an approved guideline ==

I notice that Kevin Murray has downgraded this guideline back to the &quot;proposed&quot; status.  I would revert that myself, except that I am not at all clear by what action/authority it became considered a functioning guideline.  Certainly the above poll has produced only five people who support this as a guideline.  Even without the two nay-sayers I fail to see how the five of us constitute a group that can speak for the Wikipedia community as a whole, or at least the science editors.

I for one do call for the issue of approving this as a functioning guideline be presented to the community as a whole.  [[Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)|the Village Pump policy forum]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Science|WikiProject Science]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Physics|WikiProject Physics]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Chemistry|WikiProject Chemistry]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Biology|WikiProject Biology]] are all places where this guideline can be advertised and input and approval sought.  I see little danger in this and much promise, but mostly I would like to be able to show Kevin a formal approval so that is downgrading of this guideline cannot occur again. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 02:17, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

::We don't do &quot;formal&quot; and &quot;official&quot; with respect to guidelines. What matters is if this is (1) a good idea and (2) used as such in practice.

Judged by this talk page and AFD, the answer to all three is 'yes', so this page is a de facto guideline and Kevin is the lone dissenter here. Of course, putting a notice on the village pump never hurts.

:::Kevin is not the only dissenter, I also am.  Let me enumerate some general criticisms, this time relating to the substance of the proposal.  1.  There is not a big need for this.  Most science articles up for deletion are up for other concerns than notability, primarily, concerns that the article is original research, POV, or inadequately sourced.  Although there are many debates on the test pages subpage, in very few was the critical issue the notability of the subject: [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Electric universe (concept)]], [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Socionomics]], and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Growing Earth Theory]] (and the old debates, not listed there, about [[Time Cube]]).  2.  The list of criteria, a core part of this proposal, were not used as the basis of successful arguments in any of the key examples I listed.  Rather, the test seems to be the general one of being covered in multiple independent sources, inside or outside of the scientific community.  Note that the criteria give an opportunity to supporters of OR articles (real OR, not neutral attempts at describing published research) to argue for inclusion inappropriately: see [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sorce theory]] as an example of this.  The criteria have changed since then, but the same kind of argument could be made today.  I wouldn't want to jeopardize any of those debates by having a guideline here with such minimal applicability.  3.  The list of criteria is instruction creep and isn't useful.  For articles that should be deleted, not meeting the criteria doesn't make a strong argument.  For articles that should be kept, they're okay, but arguments to delete things that meet these criteria are weak delete arguments in the first place, usually along the lines of &quot;this article is in bad shape&quot;, see [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ubiquitous computing]] for example.  The criteria seem aimed at solving a non-existant problem of the over-deletion of notable science topics.

*The fundamental flaw of [[WP:SCIENCE|Notability (science)]], is that it tries to determine only whether an article is '''scientifically''' notable. It does not consider whether an article may be notable in '''any''' other area.

*: This is a true red herring IMO.  A failure of scientific notability does not mean that an article may have notability in another manner and therefore be worthy of inclusion.  I did have wording here to that effect at one time, but it seems to have been lost.  I will see to restoring that, as I see this guideline as being usable only as a means of inclusion.  For the purposes of exclusion, the failure of a topic to merit inclusion under any guideline (including this one) is the relevant matter. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:27, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
*:  (Edit conflict) Agree with EMS; The page clearly embraces the idea that popular notability for science topics is appropriate.  Since popular notability definitely is acceptable (see the [[Time Cube]] precedent, for instance), any wording that implies otherwise should be examined.  But you aren't correctly representing the main thrust of the proposal.

::*I did not suggest that failing scientific notability means that an article MUST be notable elsewhere. I wrote that it MAY be notable elsewhere. Yet the current policy does not consider this.
::*Deleting articles based on scientific notability alone, is an incredible conceit, and should play no part of the proposed guidelines. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 17:35, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
:::*I'm not sure what your point is.  If an article is scientifically notable, fine, it's keepable.  If an article is not notable scientifically, but notable in some other way (for example, in popular culture), fine, it's keepable.  But if the article is not notable in any way at all, why should it be kept?

::::*A number of articles have already been deleted, based on whether they were scientifically notable only, or worse, ''mainstream'' scientifically notable.

:::::* So what?  I see this as something that can and should happen.  If no other grounds are being offerred to justify notability, then the article should go.  I would point out that the deleted items cited as being &quot;non-mainstream&quot; are also considered &quot;non-notable&quot;, while other items have been kept as being &quot;notable&quot; but &quot;fringe&quot;.  It seems to me that this shows that this is a reasonable and workable scheme. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 22:09, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

::::::*No other grounds for notability are offered because the articles are considered only as to whether they are scientifically notable.
::::::*For example, the article on [[Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Ralph_Juergens|Ralph Juergens was deleted]] (a) based on a Scientific notability &quot;test case&quot; (b) on the grounds that he was a &quot;non-notable non-mainstream scientist&quot;, which is accurate, but no cause for deletion by itself.
::::::*It is improper for &quot;Notability (science)&quot; to '''solely''' judge any article for deletion, as it makes no attempt to attract expert editors in other fields --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 23:12, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

:::::::* If you are saying that a deleted article had another non-scince reason for being notable, then please name it and indicate why that reason was not considered at the time.  Also do note that in such cases a request for reconsideration can be made to [[Wikipedia:Deletion review]].  However, this standard is for determining notability with respect to science, and I find it to be quite silly and disingenuous to accuse this guideline of not doing something that it is not meant to so (namely seeking non-science-related reasons for inclusion). --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 01:56, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

::::::::* Ian, I hear you.  However your objections are ''way'' off base here, because what you don't like is that a consensus of Wikipedia editors has disagreed with your stance on certain topics.  That doesn't really have any bearing on whether or not that consensus exists.  You talk like [[WP:SCIENCE]] got Ralph Juergens deleted: no.  A consensus of editors and a discussion got it deleted, and frankly, it wasn't even based on [[WP:SCIENCE]] at all, more like on [[WP:BIO]] or [[WP:PROF]].

:::::::::*No, I am criticizing the make-up of the consensus, which is predominantly science-oriented editors who decided that Ralph Juergens was not notable because he was not a mainstream scientists; That is what the summary says. The AfD was not targeted outside of Notability (Science).
:::::::::*The main reason given for deletion of &quot;Ralph Juergens&quot; was that he &quot;is only published by vanity presses&quot;; not only is this false, but it fails civility guidelines,[[WP:COI#Importance_of_civility]]. Nevertheless, this was picked up by several other editors as their reasons for supporting the AfD.
:::::::::*But this is not the place to discuss a single article, but I offer this as an example. 
:::::::::*I think it is wholly inappropriate for WP:SCI to advertise articles for deletion. WP:NOTABLE should advertise AfD, giving a editors a chance to refer to WP:SCI and OTHER notability guidelines. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 10:46, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

==One researcher POV fails NPOV==
*The third paragraph includes an incorrect statement:
:&quot;the point of view of one researcher or research term and, unless it generates a significant outside response by the scientific community or the population at large, fails NPOV&quot;
*This is a complete misunderstanding of [[WP:NPOV|NPOV]]. If we attribute a statement to a single researcher, and it conforms to [[WP:A]] and is not misrepresented, then it conforms to NPOV. The argument is whether a statement by a single researchers is ''notable'', which is completely different. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 19:26, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

::*If another attributable view is available, we describe it. If it isn't, we don't pretend there might be one. There is no double whammy.
::*Describing the POV of one person does not automatically fail NPOV, and any decent editor can describe any POV in way that fulfils NPOV.
::*Quashing a POV on the grounds that there MIGHT be a hypothetical counter-POV, fails NPOV, fails WP:A, and fails WP:V. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 00:08, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

:::::*The only requirement to provide a balanced view, is if one exists. If it doesn't, then to pretend that a view &quot;needs balancing&quot;, is presumably based on the view of an unattributable, anonymous, expert-less editor. This fails numerous Wikipedia policies.

:::::*Yet both POVs are EQUALLY valid, as long as they are not misrepresented, and can easily be described in a manner that conforms to NPOV. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 13:15, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

:::::::What you fail to realize is that there is an informal community discussion as well as a formal publication discussion. Those who are in a particular community are aware of the informal discussion and are able to tell when a topic is ignored/scoffed or when it is accepted. This cannot be reported at Wikipedia for verifiability reasons, but it still raises NPOV concerns when certain editors try to force obscure research into the forefront of an article. You are mistaking a standard of verifiability (which is the standard for how to write an article) with editorial judgement: they need not be one-in-the-same. In other words, one need not &quot;verify&quot; that there is NPOV issues because, as editors, our editorial opinions do not need to be (nor can they be) verified. The only thing that needs to be verifiable is the text of the article. We are allowed to have judgements that are external to this. As such, it is perfectly reasonable to say that there are NPOV problems with someone citing a single, isolated, though published research paper. In terms of your dark matter red herring, you have totally misconstrued the situation, and I'm fairly confident that nearly any third party not firmly ensconced in pathological skepticism toward mainstream astrophysics would find your evaluation predictably myopic. Clowe's triumphalist attitude is only justified from the standpoint of [[standing on the shoulders of giants]]. It's not like he was publishing his &quot;proof&quot; of dark matter in a vacuum -- it was a particular point that was addressed to a particular (MOND-type) objection. However, when your hypothetical John Doe bucks the established research by publishing proof against dark matter, he is publishing in a vacuum. Prof. John Doe's work is marginal and therefore marginalized by Wikipedia. Clowe's work is mainstream and therefore reported by Wikipedia. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:47, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
::::::::SA is quite right about verifiability vs. editorial judgement.  However, I have to say I worry when editorial judgement of this type comes into dispute.  Wikipedia needs sources for two reasons: one is to have attributions in the articles, but another reason is that it levels the playing field in editorial discussions.  Inherently, experts on Wikipedia are not set above ordinary editors, but they may be more familiar with the subject in question.  But experts have to prove themselves, just like anyone else.  Fundamentally, Wikipedia is a community of equal editors.  So, this is a good argument ''for'' [[WP:SCIENCE]]: in order to avoid having to rely on editorial judgement too heavily, we look for a higher standard of quality in sources for scientific topics, and where that doesn't exist, we should avoid covering the subject.

:::::::::*Let's not mix up NPOV and editorial judgment. As I said earlier, the statement in the introduction is incorrect concerning NPOV. I also said it may concern notability, so I'm not dismissing the point. But let's be accurate as editors.
:::::::::*The idea that a community has informal discussions which a particular editor may be aware, is worthless. It is not verifiable, nor attributable. 
:::::::::*I know THREE different communities, all of whom have informal discussions, and promise peer reviewed papers that I could mention too. Also worthless.
:::::::::*An encyclopedia does not run on material gleaned from Chinese whispers via anonymous, unaccountable editors.
:::::::::*I had previously brought this up at the Neutrality Project, see &quot;[[Wikipedia_talk:Neutrality_Project#NPOV_misunderstanding|NPOV misunderstanding]]&quot;. They agree. A singular POV can be described in an NPOV manner. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 16:01, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

NPOV is inherently based in editorial judgement. The only way that someone determines whether there is a problem with NPOV is by making an editorial judgement. That's why the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{POV}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag comes with the wording it does. Disputes arise between editors over NPOV: if there was a singular editor there would never be NPOV issues from the standpoint of writing an article. While I agree with Mangojuice that editors are judged external to their status as &quot;experts&quot; (see ongoing conflicts over [[WP:EXPERT]] for example), the community doesn't deny the existence of experts either. No one is saying that the encyclopedia should be &quot;run&quot; on expert judgement or the whispers of whatever anonymous and unaccountable ethnic group, but people are saying that editors may come to the table with these concerns. That's the essence of the NPOV guideline: all the points-of-view are placed on the table and the marginalization happens per the outside community and references to the outside world. No one is saying that a singular POV cannot be described, but people are saying that singular POVs present unique difficulties when writing an encyclopedia that is supposed to be NPOV. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 17:39, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

:*Indeed, all the POVs are placed on the table. And if there is just one POV (because there is one WP:V/WP:RS/WP:A), then we can still write that POV so that it conforms to NPOV, regardless of whether you or I or anyone else agrees with the POV, and regardless of whether it is mainstream of pseudoscience.
:*In which case, the statement in the third paragraph that I described above, is incorrect. A view from a single researcher may fail a criteria, but there is no reason for it to fail NPOV; and if it does, any decent editor can re-write it so that it conforms to NPOV. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 19:19, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
:::If there is only one notable POV, then sure, we write about it. In which case the statement in the third paragraph is correct. A view from a single research written about on Wikipedia does have editorial issues related to NPOV for the reasons delineated because the alternatives may exist but cannot be included without falling into original research. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 19:23, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
::::*The statement is incorrect because a single POV does not fail NPOV unless it is written badly, in which case any competent editor can correct it. Sure, the statement may be allowed because it is notable. But it won't fail because of NPOV.
::::*A single POV that has been published elsewhere does not not fail &quot;Original research&quot;, because [[WP:NOR]] &quot;refers to '''unpublished''' facts&quot;. (my emphasis) --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 19:51, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

You are missing the point. Perhaps I should post here the statement that you dispute:

:''Research published in a reputable publication passes these thresholds but reflects the point of view of one researcher or research term and, unless it generates a significant outside response by the scientific community or the population at large, focusing on such research in a Wikipedia article does not adequately conform to [[WP:NPOV|Wikipedia's policy on neutrality]], in particular the section on [[WP:NPOV#Undue weight|undue weight]].''

You'll note that the point being made is that simply quoting published work is not good enough. Why isn't it good enough? Because unless the work in question has generated discussion it has not been vetted outside of Wikipedia to make it possible to write an article on the subject that adheres to the spirit and letter of NPOV.
--[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 20:36, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
::The POV of a single researcher in a single first-rate peer-reviewed publication, has normally been assessed by 2 or usually 3 independent scientists with a tendency to be ciritical. The assumption made by colleagues it that such results are correct unless proven otherwise. Are we supposed to be more critical of physics that he physicists who review for PRL? Then, if discussed by independent sources, as most scientific papers are, it is considered worth citing and commenting one. Reputable journals expect items listed as references to be relevant to the new work also. I'm a librarian. i think many articles in most library journals are basically trivial if not junk altogether.. But they are considered valuable by my colleagues in general, and its their trms that matter. I will judge by reporting theirs',  not imposing my own.'''[[User:DGG|DGG]]''' 09:02, 9 April 2007 (UTC)

:The statement which I quoted above, is as follows:
::&quot;the point of view of one researcher or research term and, unless it generates a significant outside response by the scientific community or the population at large, fails NPOV&quot;
:A single POV may fail, or being accepted by some other criteria. But a single POV does not fail NPOV (unless an editor writes poorly). 
:*To suggest that a statement based on a single POV, changes it's NPOV standing, depending on some other ''potential'' discussion whose view is yet to be determined, is illogical. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 20:46, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

If your point is that someone can attribute a single point of view in a fashion that is NPOV, that is absolutely correct. However, not every attributable point can be written about in a neutral fashion. An example of a quote that may be non-neutral though properly attributed and sourced is given at [[WP:FRINGE#Sourcing and attribution]]. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 00:01, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

:*Since describing a single POV can be achieved in an NPOV fashion, then the description in the third paragraph is incorrect which says that a single POV without response fails NPOV.
:*Judging/assessing a single POV is another matter altogether. But just because there may be no attributable assessments, does not make the description of a single POV automatically fail NPOV. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 00:34, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

I do not agree with the demand that not only must something be said in a respected peer reviewed journal, but that we must wait for other independent researchers to chime in, in OTHER respected peer reviewed journals, and agree with the first researcher that the claim is valid. The first post would constitute a reliable source satisfying [[WP:ATT]] and would be usable in a Wikipedia article. Similarly a book from a respected publisher would constitute a reliable source, without waiting for some other authority to write another book that says &quot;I agree with the first book.&quot; The demand places the bar way too high. It may be years before someone completely independent of the first researcher publishes the demanded blessing of the first researcher's claim. [[User:Edison|Edison]] 20:20, 9 April 2007 (UTC)

==[[Schmidt Sting Pain Index]]==
Can some of you knowledgable and discerning scientist Wikipedians take a look at this please? This article has currently been getting some coverage in popular &quot;gee whiz funny link of the day... how goofy!&quot; type blogs ( I hate it when this happens and the article in question is dubious... I think it gives a bad impression of wikipedia), but it seems to be mainly based on the idea that this one insect scientist guy wrote some goofy comments for an insect sting pain index one day. Ok, I agree that insect scientists are allowed to have senses of humour (WITHIN LIMITS, for the sake of us all), but I am concerned that 1) this scale is not really widespread and may be just one scale promoted by one guy without much acceptance in the insect expert community. 2) the pdf article linked which this wikipedia entry seems to be based on does not seem to say that Schmidt actually wrote those goofy comments. Its a bit ambiguous, but its seems to say that &quot;the media&quot; (without specifying what media) came up with the goofy comments to append to Schmidt's original dry scale(I think this may be another case where people exaggerate or misinterpret what an article is saying). I dont have any access to science journal databases, and am certainly no science or insect expert. But these concerns and quick scans of google books and google scholar led me to bring this issue to wiser heads. Thanks very much  for checking this out.

The index also has been mentioned in popular science pubs; though it doesn't appear to be taken seriously by scientists.  A scientifically-based pain index would be interesting (though I decline any offers to participate in such research); both this and the related Starr index appear to be little more than the opinions of the bug guys in question.  The article certainly dances on the edge of notability.  --[[User:EngineerScotty|EngineerScotty]] 05:30, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

******Ok, once again, in case anyone can actually respond on my point: the list of criteria here seems to be a misguided attempt to define reasons for notability that no one brings up in debates.  If the issue was the over-''deletion'' of science articles, having these criteria would make sense.  But it seems to me that the main thrust of this proposal is in the opposite direction.  These are just fodder for disagreement (see [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sorce theory]] for instance) and distract from the main point about the POV and OR issues involved in using only sources from a single author.

********Good: a direct response.  Two brief points: (1) Arbcom never asked for criteria, but they did encourage developing a guideline, which is different.  (2) The EU deletion debate looks very different to me - there, the argument was done from first principles and it worked very nicely, and it skirted around the edge of these criteria (no one ever talked about whether the EU concept was &quot;textbook science&quot; or had institutional support)... and as for extended discussions with Iantresman... I don't think the criteria will make one bit of difference, and that's not a very good reason anyway.  Long-winded debate... I don't think we should seek to avoid it as a general principle, debate is a good thing.  Criteria would simplify the job but scientific topics aren't exactly overwhelming the AfD lists.

== General notability guideline template ==
Since the general notability guideline is central to most sub-pages, someone came up with the idea of creating a centralized template which will be consistent among the permutations from WP:N.  Please see whether we can make this work here.  The text is meant to be fairly generic, but it may make sense to add text following the template for fine tuning, or help us to make the template more applicable if it is not reflecting the consensus for notability.  I certainly didn't get everything that I wanted, but I'm very happy to see the compromises that make this a fairly representive of the attitude of the project.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 01:12, 7 April 2007 (UTC)

==Merging [[Wikipedia:Notability (numbers)]]==
What are the thoughts on merging [[Wikipedia:Notability (numbers)]] into this guideline proposal?  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 19:15, 25 April 2007 (UTC)

I've added a brief section which is the meat from the numbers guideline.  This seems appropriately and neatly combined here.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 16:29, 15 May 2007 (UTC)
*It's a bad idea, as explained on the talk page of WP:NUM.

== Scope creep ==

I may be beating a dead horse here, but all the references to NPOV, proponents and advocacy make it seem like this is about pseudoscience/fringe science, and the discussion above seems to confirm it. As it tries to apply to specialised but uncontroversial science, not much of it bears any resemblance to reality. --[[User:Abu-Fool Danyal ibn Amir al-Makhiri|Abu-Fool Danyal ibn Amir al-Makhiri]] 02:29, 6 June 2007 (UTC)

== Proposal concerns (LV) ==
Note that I came here from a couple of AfDs which were trying to present this as policy criteria for an article's deleltion.  As I read down the line, I encountered several problems with the proposed guideline.  I apologize if any and all of the below have been covered in the Talk Archives, which I am not going to read now.

Problems that I have at present with the proposal:

*Introduction:
:* &quot;A topic that is acceptable under this guideline is an appropriate part of Wikipedia.&quot;
::Pretty sweeping blanket statement, to me.  No other Notability criteria I'm aware of suggests that &quot;if it passes this, it's in.&quot;  Indeed, it seems to violate the principle of a Guideline to me, which always limits itself to allow potential exceptions.  Further, each section usually defines which criteria are primary and which are secondary.
*Notability of topics related to science:
:*&quot;Decisions about including or excluding material must always reflect the opinions of outside authorities, not those of Wikipedia editors.&quot;
::I know this has been mentioned above, but I want to echo this concern:  Decisions about including or excluding material must always reflect the consensus of the Wikipedia editors.  Anything else beyond that is helpful clarification, or it becomes fodder for people to [[WP:IAR]].
::I'd feel much more comfortable with something like, ''&quot;Deicions about including or excluding material on a scientific basis ought to be supported by the opinions and stated facts of outside authorities, as per [[WP:RS|Wikpedia:Reliable Sources]].&quot;''  Start throwing 'musts' around in anything but policy (perhaps only unbreakable/unmodifiable policy) and you'll get a lot of irate editors, scientific or not.
:*&quot;Although publication creates verifiability and reputable journals are reliable sources, publication by itself is not a sufficient (and sometimes not necessary) standard for encyclopedic notability. Unpublished research fails no original research and often lacks verifiability, so it is unacceptable by policy. Research published in a reputable publication passes these thresholds but reflects the point of view of one researcher or research term and, unless it generates a significant outside response by the scientific community or the population at large, focusing on such research in a Wikipedia article does not adequately conform to Wikipedia's policy on neutrality, in particular the section on undue weight. This guideline clarifies how the Wikipedia community has applied NPOV to articles on scientific topics. It does however not apply to the inclusion of scientific research as authorative sources within articles. The criterion for such sources is not that they are notable, but that they are reliable.&quot;
::Wha?  Could this be any more complex?  I actually had to diagram this paragraph out to understand it.  My hypothesis is most editors will not.  Can't you simply say it is normally necessary to follow the general notability guidelines with respect to neutral, multiple, independent, verifiabile, reliable sources?  And if you do that, what is the point of this whole section - I'm seriously not understanding how this adds anything to present guidelines.
* Criteria / General
:*&quot;1. Widely cited. Papers covering the topic have been widely1 commented on in academic writing within the topic's field.
::2. Outside notability. The topic is notable due to significant coverage in reliable sources outside of academic publications.&quot;  
::So we want articles only commented upon widely by multiple academic sources, which also are commented on outside academic sources?  Seems pretty wide, to me.
::Aside from that, I know I read somewhere that Wikipedia is not just a general encyclopedia, but can cover articles appropriate to special subject encyclopedias as well.  Thus 2. might well fail, as most specialist encyclopedias I am aware of have many articles which would only be known inside the discipline the encyclopedia represents.
:*&quot;Notable topics which are primarily non-scientific... [etc.]&quot;
::Boy, I'm going to love the AfDs which try to define whether a topic is &quot;science&quot; or not trying to use this.  Not to mention the arguments you'll get whether or not cosmology (for example) has a scientific basis or not.  Not to mention you're setting up a criteria which is so subjective it will rarely-if-ever be able to objectively define where this guideline would be relevant or not.
::Also, you will get editors asking whether the guideline itself applies or not - something I don't think I've ever seen with any of the other specialty N's about the guideline ''itself''.  I don't need to know if Burpa-Cola has been covered in the Cola News and CNN, or if Billy Bob Arthbutnott has both parlimentary opinions as well as the Sun documenting his career to know that Corp or People:Politicians applies.
*Scientific terms
:Again, how does this get beyond neologisms in a way that Avoid Neologisms doesn't, aside from adding the words &quot;scientific literature&quot;?
*Numbers and Sources
:*&quot;1. Have professional mathematicians published papers on this topic?
::2. Is the sequence listed in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences? (In the case of sequences of rational numbers, does the OEIS have the sequences of numerators and denominators of the relevant fractions?)
::3. Do MathWorld and PlanetMath have articles on this topic?&quot;
:::This may be taken from WProj numbers, I don't know.  But are you stipulating that 2 and 3 are reliable sources? (The Sources section has exactly this same problem.  You're controlling what is considered a Reliable Source without allowing the Wikipedia community at large to define that.  I have a problem with that - if I were arguing Notability(Religion), I would not want it to say that the Bible is an authorized source and any other 'holy' texts by default would have to prove themselves.)
*Sources
:*&quot;Scientific discovery is often disconnected from public discourse, so standard methods of sourcing and verifying are not always applicable. A scientific topic which yields low hit counts in the Google test...&quot;
::That's nice.  The Google test is widely regarded as discredited anyway.  Yes, I know it's still used, but it's questionability is known.
::Also, verifying and sourcing is verfying and sourcing.  I believe what's being aimed at here is scientific notability may have a smaller and different base (with different types of sourcing) for inclusion than other forms of notability.  So why not say that?  Except that above you're demanding 'popular' coverage as well as academic.
:*&quot;Web (and library) searches should therefore be evaluated based on the quality rather than the quantity of the finds.&quot;
::Thus, you allow extreme subjectivity creep, unless you are going to make further instruction creep in what constitutes scientific quality.  (My Jung is better than your Freud.  My Hawking beats your Einstein.  My t test is better than your bean counting.)  Common sense might be able to dictate that, but science is full of periods of flying in the face of qualitative common sense and succeeding - because it's right.
:*&quot;The following is a list of sources with qualifications of their usefulness.&quot;
::Again, you're preaching what is and isn't acceptable as a source, without allowing the community consensus to decide this over time. 
:*&quot;Google, Yahoo.... [etc]&quot; 
::Uh, again, how is this any different from Google test?

Finally, may I invite you to consider that most notability guidelines are much less complex and much more tolerant of letting individual cases be decided as individual cases?  And I hope that the question about &quot;Have we reached consensus?&quot; is asking if you as the editors have reached consensus about what you want to present to the community as a whole, as opposed to &quot;Are we ready to make this policy ourselves?&quot;

It may seem like I'm pissing all over your proposal.  I hope it doesn't, because I'd like to see a Notability(Science) guideline.  But I want it to be one that's usable and used - I wouldn't do either with this, and I'd argue as need be when someone tries to use this as a vote justification (which will happen, whether you want it to or not.)  Sorry for the length of the diatribe.

The rejected tag is appropriate and should stand until there is adequate discussion here to demonstrate active interest in the proposal.

It looks like a number of the contributors here are no longer active at WP: Lantreman ws banned, BDJ and Science Appologist have quit, Minder Binder, Abu-Fool Danyal ibn Amir al-Makhiri, and Laughing Vulcan have not contributed substantially since June and at all since mid-July.   &lt;s&gt;Trials and Errors and Radiant are advocating reinstating this as a proposal&lt;/s&gt;, but I don't think that there are enough editors who see this as a need.

* What I see now is something that is so watered down and nebulous that it cannot act as a genuine policy.  If people want to revive this effort, then we need to return to a version like [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Notability_%28science%29&amp;oldid=117329647 this one] and work from there.  IMO, what happenned to this effort is that a number of people whose pet articles were running afoul of this proposed policy chose to get involved with the blatant intent to sabotage it and remove its impact on their work, and unfortunately succeeded in doing so.&lt;br&gt;IMO, there is a genuine need for a policy like this to clarify what &quot;notability&quot; and &quot;verifiability&quot; mean in the context of a science article, and how [[WP:UNDUE]] should be applied.  It may be that this is an issue that is best handled by the admins with the advice and consent of the community so that we can avoid the pitfalls of the past. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:49, 20 August 2007 (UTC)
*I see, if not frequent, so at least [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere/Wikipedia:Notability_%28science%29&amp;limit=500&amp;from=0 recurrent use] of this guideline/proposed guideline/essay, very much in keeping with the rather low number of science-related AfD discussions. Absence of discussion on the talk page certainly doesn't establish rejection. I agree with EMS that the two-item version is watered down beyond recognition of the original version, and I don't see any consensus for it. ~ [[User:Trialsanderrors|trialsanderrors]] 16:07, 20 August 2007 (UTC)
:: Per [[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines]]: ''&quot;A rejected page is any proposal for which consensus support is not present, regardless of whether there is active discussion or not. Consensus need not be fully opposed; if consensus is neutral on the issue and unlikely to improve, the proposal is likewise rejected. It is considered bad form to hide this fact, e.g. by removing the tag. Making small changes will not change this fact, nor will repetitive arguments. Generally it is wiser to rewrite a rejected proposal from scratch and start in a different direction.&quot;'' --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 16:14, 20 August 2007 (UTC)

::: It seems to me that a lot of work has gone into turning this into something that everyone can reject.

== Reverted to earlier version ==

I have reverted the article to the form of lat March, with some twaking of the lead and the first section.  The revised first section now has a simple first paragraph that states the need to this policy as succinctly as I can.  The next two paragraphs have had their order exchanged so that the farily dry &quot;relevance&quot; paragraph comes last.  The previous last paragraph has been removed as an unreadable mess.  (I believe I drafted that paragraph originally, but it really never worked as intended, and only got worse over time.)

The {{tl|rejected}} tag has been kept as a matter of form, with the {{tl|proposed}} tag just commented out but still present.  I for one would be happy to see this version go back to &quot;proposed&quot; status, but I want to see if others are on-board for doing that.  Let's just say that after having taken a rest, I am ready and willing to work towards acceptance of a functional version of this as a policy or guideline if others are. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 18:24, 20 August 2007 (UTC)

:Personally, I don't see a lot of point reviving this.  The criteria have always been an attempt to change practice rather than an attempt to document practice, and to most people, the criteria and the proposal are one and the same.  The criteria really haven't caught on, and from my experience, people rely on other policies for scientific topics, like [[WP:OR]] and [[WP:V]], and where notability is needed, the general [[WP:N]] seems to be sufficient and its use is accepted.

:: Having looked more closely at the edit history, I find that your attempt to streamline this two two items has met fairly stiff resistance.  Then again, that is little wonder since your proposed consolidation ends up being little more than a restatement of pre-existing policy.  The goal of this proposal is to set up guidelines that go beyond the current policies and which are adapted to the issues which are unique to science.  Wikiepdia has very much outgrown [[WP:NOR|&quot;No original research&quot;]] and the requirement to use [[peer review]]ed [[scientific journal|journals]].  What do you do with a source that is &quot;peer reviewed&quot; but where the peers are fellow followers of a [[fringe science|fringe theory]]?  What do you do about the use of [[Nature (journal)|Nature magazine]], which is highly respected but does not use peer review to help select its articles?  What do you make of a theory published in a respected scientific journals but on which noone has cared to comment except the author?  What do you do with the [[cold fusion]] controversy created by Pons and Fleishman back in 1987 which obviously is notable within science but which was never respected by it?  There will not be many of these to contend with, but when they do appear this guideline will be invaluable.
:::::Please excuse my comment here, but the article content of Nature is peer reviewed. Like some other journals, it has on rare occasions published things based on consensus of the key editors, without formal peer review. The news content is not, of course, just editorially prepared -- by the most careful people around. It was they who caught the similarity of the stem cell photos after the peer reviewers missed it.

:: You like to cite [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sorce theory]] as a place where this guideline did not work.  For that I solidly disagree.  That article's creator had to play all kinds of games with these criteria to make a case for keeping the article.  In the end, his attempts to make the article look acceptable only helped to do it in.  In context this is a farly powerful tool.  In addition, it is not going to do in fringe science articles.  For example, I helped by have an aritcle on a book by [[Halton Arp]] kept because it was noted within the field of astronomy and also gained some measure of attention from the public at large.  That press coverage (both scientific and popular) could establish notability as described here was helpful in that discussion. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 01:03, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

:::You might note that my reduction to two criteria stood for over two months without comment.  You may also note that coverage by press and by scientific sources were the criteria I left in place, since those are the only part of the criteria that are useful.  What I object to are the other criteria, like &quot;textbook science&quot; or &quot;popular belief&quot; that are redundant and provide loopholes for argumentative POV pushers.  Can you hypothesize an example where a topic is &quot;textbook science&quot; or has a &quot;prominent advocate&quot; or has &quot;institutional support&quot; where the topic would be acceptable for Wikipedia ''without'' significant coverage in independent, reliable sources, academic or otherwise?

::::I am not sure whether I agree with you or not. I certainly think that there are science articles that are best referenced by standard textbooks, particularly for articles that are at the level of high school or early university science. For example, we probably do not want to source a peer reviewed journal on [[density]] and we do not. Are textbooks reliable sources? If so we do not need to mention &quot;textbook science&quot;, but if they are not, we probable do. --[[User:Bduke|Bduke]] 03:09, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

::::::: As for the other criteria: you agree on 3 and 4.  6 is totally pointless, because none of the criteria would expire once met.  7 obviously must require sourcing to back it up or it's totally vacuous and anyone could claim it about anything.  And anything discussed in a legitimate textbook is already covered in a reliable source, and I highly doubt that we'd ever find a case where one textbook mentions a topic but absolutely no other sources do.  Yeah, I agree, if we pare it any further, the ''criteria'' say nothing more than [[WP:N]] does.. so maybe we should lose the criteria altogether, or just spend more time explaining the issues that arise in assessing the quality of sources, especially academic ones.

(unindent) I think that you have just made an excellent suggestions in calling for an explanation of how to assess the reliability and relevance of sources.  Given some of the issues I have had recently with the anti-relativists over at [[talk:Herbert Dingle]], this makes a lot of sense.  (In those discussions, at least one person would take anything that he could find from a &quot;peer reviewed journal&quot; as evidence of a conflict over relativity and the [[twin paradox]].  Said contributions come from almost unknown overseas journals and in another case a blatantly anti-relativity publisher.)  I would still keep the remaining criteria as a way of saying that those things are the primary hallmarks of scientific notability, while noting that other options for notability are not prohibited. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:20, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

:I believe that's better, but I still think we should remove the criteria.  The problem is, people always seem to conflate a notability guideline and its criteria, while all other text is ignored.  By not having criteria, we would force people to read the discussion about the reliability of scientific sources.  (Actually, come to think about it, &quot;Notability (science)&quot; may not be the best name.  What about &quot;Reliable sources (scientific)&quot;?)

:: The criteria don't exist for the benefit of those that would abuse them but instead for the benefit of those that are looking for good guidance on what is acceptable.  The creator of an article will invariably try to defend it against an AfD.  IMO, if the article's creator can make a case that their article is acceptable under this criteria and everyone agrees, then these criteria have done a service in helping people to make that decision.  Similarly, if people listen to the creator's case and conclude that it does not hold water, then the criteria will also have helped by focussing the debate on the relevant issues and helping to bring about the deletion.  So as I see it these criteria overall are helpful.  Besides, it really is in the absense of clear guidelines that you get the nastiest debates. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 19:01, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

(a) Notability, (b) reliability of a source, and (b) reliable of the facts in that source, are all quite different, and tell us how to describe information, not whether to include it. If Arp publishes some information in an obscure overseas publications, and Stephen Hawkins in in Nature, Arp's supporters will find his article more notable, and no less reliable. And if Hawkins is described in a textbook, then it tells us that his ideas have a wider readership, and neither are as popular as today's astrology column.  &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment was added by [[Special:Contributions/{{{IP|{{{User|84.244.165.174}}}}}}|{{{IP|{{{User|84.244.165.174}}}}}}]] ([[User talk:{{{IP|{{{User|84.244.165.174}}}}}}|talk]]) {{{Time|17:34, August 21, 2007 (UTC)}}}&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Abandon this as an unnecessary complication==

Whether a peer review journal, a textbook, a popular book, a university hosted website or a notable persons personal site  is sufficiently reliable, reputable, or secondary is probably best treated on a case by case basis, and in any case this is not a problem specific to science.

Are there any controversial articles that are better treated by Notability (science) than by WP:NOR, WPV, and WP:N?  I think not.  I think there are too many guidelines, especially where they overlap.  True science should only need to satisfy WP:NOR and WP:V.  Where the subject is not true science, or is borderline, a further test should be simply whether others have written about it.  WP:N provides this test.  A lot of work has been invested in this project page, but that is not sufficient reason to adopt it.  It is rule creep, and it does damage by obfuscating more important policies and guidelines.

There seems to be tendency here for some to want a guideline to provide a science-quality test.  This is not an encyclopaedia’s role.  The ascribing of “Finge science”, “pseudo science” or “lunacy” to any theory is a job for third party sources, not for wikipedia rules.  

EMS suggests that some nasty debates exist because of the weakness of this guideline.  Some elaboration would be nice.  Discussion above suggests to me that the relativity article needs work, not that wikipedia needs more rules.

This project page should be abandoned.  Science is well covered by WP:OR and WP:V, and where notability is needed, the general WP:N seems to be sufficient and its use is accepted. --[[User:SmokeyJoe|SmokeyJoe]] 02:08, 22 August 2007 (UTC)

It’s always about sourcing, specifically whether the sources are sufficiently independent, sufficiently secondary, sufficiently reputable (not a blog or similar), or covers the subject in sufficient depth.  These are all straight WP:N issues, deriving directly from a combination of WP:NOR and WP:V.  There is plenty of evidence of spirited debate in places about the science of the content involved, and this sometimes is uncivil, but such spirited debate seems to me to be irrelevant to the debates, and always a symptom of editors who are too far into OR editing and are not looking at the subject objectively.  This is why Notability (science) may do more harm than good.  It suggests that there is something special about science.  The criteria for inclusion in wikipedia do not depend upon the science.

==physics? i think not==
do not confuse the observer effect with the uncertainty principle. the uncertainty principle has nothing to do with &quot;observing&quot;, it has to do with measuring. the observer effect is a supposed effect of observing an event and the influence of your presence on the event. no one would ever have to actually observe a particle's position to obfuscate its momentum, the mere act of using the photons to measure its position, even if nobody ever observed it, would suffice.

-------------
don't you have to observe in order to measure?
-------------

Indeed.  But what does measuring have to do with Quantum Mechanics exactly?  

To measure is to observe the results of a measurement process [that ascertains the subject measurement].  Humans observe with their senses — the senses that humans have.  Other conscious beings, perhaps including computers, may have other senses with which they can implement tools for making measurements.  At the end of the day, measuring ''ALWAYS'' involves observing.  

Tools used by beings to make measurements are limited (in their accuracy) by various factors including the limitations of ones senses.  The often-mentioned example of bouncing a photon off of an atom to measure its position illustrates the problem with knowing the position ''AND'' momentum of ''THAT'' atom at the ''SAME MOMENT'' in time.  The concept usually centers on the fact that the position measurement photon will change the momentum of the subject atom.  But aren't there other aspects of this problem?  

In the limit (considering the non-zero mass of the atom and the non-zero energy of the photon), can one ever know perfectly even the position alone?  Perhaps so, since the mechanical inertance of the atom precludes its reaction at ''THAT'' infinitesimal instant in time.  

Why is not ''THIS'' example an instance of &quot;observer effect&quot; rather than the uncertainty principle, per se?  If one seeks only to measure the position alone, then maybe it is neither.  Then again, is it not &quot;Observer Effect&quot; even if the momentum is changed by measuring only the position?  One would think so.  

Well, what if we start with measuring the momentum &quot;first&quot;?  How does one measure momentum, anyway?  Again, we observers devise a measurement process that allows our senses to detect the &quot;answer.&quot;  Momentum is mass times velocity.  If we know the mass, we might then seek to measure the velocity.  Human observers tend to ascertain velocity by measuring position at two points in time.  For non-zero velocities, this means two different points in space, of course.  Yet, [instantaneous] velocity is ''DEFINED'' at only one point in space and time.  Thus, one cannot measure velocity (or momentum) in this manner: one must ''WAIT'' to ''SEE'' how fast it is moving, and this yields only an average (not instantaneous) value.  

Before continuing on to propose measuring momentum, per se, by some other means (say, smashing the atom into an obstacle at a known position), we should note that the Uncertainty Principle pertains only to Quantum Mechanics.  In ''THAT'' world, particles are not particles; rather, they are probability density functions.  The interpretation of this ''MODEL'' of a particle says the position and momentum of the subject particle are INHERENTLY uncertain by virtue of the mathematical model itself.  To precisely derive the position, one must manipulate the model in a manner that causes the momentum &quot;to drop out of the formula,&quot; and vice versa.  

The relationship between position and momentum described by Quantum Mechanics is somewhat like the relationship between the time domain and the frequency domain described by the Fourier Transform.  One can say that there is some similarity as well between position and velocity in Classical Mechanics.  In fact, the description above with knowing the velocity versus position of the atom is exactly that: Classical Mechanics. 

Following this line of thinking, one (''such as this user who is not fluent in the intricate semantics of Quantum Theory'') might be likely to reach these conclusions: 
 

'''1. Using &quot;particulate&quot; atoms and photons to describe the Uncertainty Principle of Quantum Mechanics is ''flat wrong''.''' 

'''2. One does not observe Quantum Mechanics.  Rather, one uses that theory to make calculations to explain the observations of certain experiments.'''

'''3. Measurements ''ALWAYS'' involve observations and therefore also ''ALWAYS'' involve the Observer Effect.  Perhaps this ''IS'' the “Theory of the Observer Effect.”'''

'''4. The Uncertainty Principle of Quantum Mechanics and the Observer Effect are ''fundamentally'' unrelated.'''  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:JimRodgers|JimRodgers]] ([[User talk:JimRodgers|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/JimRodgers|contribs]]) 12:54, 31 July 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

For some reason this article is more focused on what the observer effect is not. --[[User:Nathanael Bar-Aur L.|Nathanael Bar-Aur L.]] 20:09, 10 April 2007 (UTC)

From what I understood from other sources, the observer effect is basically the collapsing of a quantum system's wavefunction that happens the moment a measurement in made upon it (by an &quot;observer&quot;), therefore cancelling any superposition that may have existed beforehand, and giving specific definition to the renderings. Is this correct? --[[User:Nathanael Bar-Aur L.|Nathanael Bar-Aur L.]] 20:21, 10 April 2007 (UTC)

==Suggestions==
Current article states &quot;not that of the driveshaft, along the axis of the car&quot;.
Add a paragraph that illustrates this with the driveshaft of the front-engine, rear-wheel-drive Porsche 928.
Also industrial examples and diagrams from mechanical engineering and classical mechanics.
e.g. a torque tube to allign parts of a hinge operated by two hydraulic cylinders.&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/206.188.57.60|206.188.57.60]] ([[User talk:206.188.57.60|talk]]) 14:42, 30 October 2006 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;

== Diagrams ==
Can anyone find a picture of this? I'm having a very hard time picturing what this would look like...[[User:70.157.134.125|70.157.134.125]] 01:01, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

==Accuracy==
This page is not really accurate. Cars like the STS, Corvette, etc. have independent rear suspensions, and the torque tube is not used to transmit acceleration forces in these vehicles. Rather, it is because they have trans-axles in the rear of the car and it connects the trans-axle with the engine in the front. However, I am not enough of an expert on the subject to write a clear and well-written clarification so I have just added some templates to the top of the page. --[[User:Ozziegt|Ozziegt]] ([[User talk:Ozziegt|talk]]) 21:33, 1 July 2009 (UTC)

:Corvette since at least 1988 doesn't have a torque tube (unless they put one in later), and apart from the Miata I'm hard pushed to think of an IRS that uses one. I agree, this article is pretty horrid, it needs a rewrite rather than refs. [[User:Greglocock|Greglocock]] ([[User talk:Greglocock|talk]]) 11:13, 2 July 2009 (UTC)

:Corvettes since the late 90's do indeed have torque tubes, of the same type that the Porsche 924/944/928 etc use.  All the mentioned Porsches are IRS and use a torque tube.  Part of the probem with this article is that it lumps very diverse systems together;  the early Ford systems are completely different from the Corvette/Porsche systems.  Both are classified as torque tubes, but the article does not focus on the essence of a TT, which is the use of a smaller torque-transmitting element inside a carrier. The carrier may or may not be static and may or may not be carrying driveline forces (like the Fords). [[User:52FordF-1|52FordF-1]] ([[User talk:52FordF-1|talk]]) 15:44, 18 July 2009 (UTC)

::Yup my bad, 2005 Corvette (as a random example) uses a transaxle and a torque tube. Note that the Corvette system is different to the Peugoet one, as the latter includes an articulating joint at the front whereas the Corvette system does not. This is a big deal, to a driveline engineer at least.[[User:Greglocock|Greglocock]] ([[User talk:Greglocock|talk]]) 23:25, 18 July 2009 (UTC)

:Agreed. The article as written is essentially BS. A torque tube fundamentally counteracts the torque of the driveshaft; the alternative is that the torque is counteracted by the torsional rigidity of the frame (the net torque must, obviously, be zero otherwise the rear of the car would rotate). The torque tube often does transfer forward wheel force to the front of the car, but this is not inherent in the mere fact of having a torque tube: there must still be a mechanism locating the wheels longitudinally relative to the diff/transaxle. This is analogous to the usual need to locate the wheels relative to the frame (most simply, with leaf springs) in order to move the car forward.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/110.175.57.184|110.175.57.184]] ([[User talk:110.175.57.184|talk]]) 05:05, 18 March 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== simple definition? ==

It has been my understanding from looking through service manuals and talking to mechanics that the corvette style torque tubes are just an enclosed driveshaft that connects a front mounted engine to the rear mounted transmission (with fully independent rear suspension)

I guess it's not simply called a 'driveshaft' in a classical sense since it doesn't connect a front mounted transmission to the rear differential  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/184.57.87.173|184.57.87.173]] ([[User talk:184.57.87.173|talk]]) 20:38, 15 August 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</text>

'''''Hello!'''''

Thanks for uploading some pictures to Wikipedia.  I wanted to make sure you were aware of some of the requirements and good practices for uploaded images.

*'''Pick an image name.'''
:When [[Special:Upload|uploading]] an image, pick a file name that is descriptive, and unique.  Remember that many images may be uploaded about the same topic, and remember that names are case sensitive.

*'''Source the image.'''
:On the [[Help:Image page|image description page]], explain where the image came from.  If you created the image yourself, then say so.  If it's from the web, give a URL.  If it's a screenshot of a movie or game, or a scan from a book, give the title.

*'''Provide copyright and license information.'''
:This part is a little bit trickier, but it's very important.  The copyright of the image generally belongs to whomever created it.
::''If it's a photograph you took, or an image you created'' (modifying an image that already exists doesn't count) in software like [[Photoshop]] or [[GIMP]], then you own the copyright.  To upload it to Wikipedia, you must agree to license it under the [[GFDL]] (which allows anyone to use it, but requires that they give credit to the original author and requires that any further edit to the image be licensed under the GFDL as well) or release it into the [[public domain]] (which allows anyone to use it for any purpose without restriction.)  Do this by placing an appropriate [[WP:ICT|tag]] on the [[Wikipedia:image description page|image description page]], like &amp;#123;{[[Template:GFDL|GFDL]]}} or &amp;#123;{[[Template:PD|PD]]}}.  Be sure to mention that you created the image.  If you're using &amp;#123;{[[Template:PD|PD]]}}, you may also want to use &amp;#123;{[[Template:NoRightsReserved|NoRightsReserved]]}}, since there is some dispute as to whether one may grant items into the public domain.
::''If you didn't create the image,'' or the copyright somehow belongs to another party (like a screenshot, which you might &quot;create&quot;, but the copyright belongs to the author of the movie or video game), then you need to find another [[WP:ICT|tag]] that describes the copyright status of the image.  Images used on Wikipedia need to be free for our use and the use of [[WP:FORKS|sites]] which reproduce our content.  This means that images cannot have a restriction such as &quot;only for use by Wikipedia&quot;, or &quot;for non-commercial use only&quot;, or &quot;for educational use&quot;.  Images without a free license may be usable in certain articles under [[WP:FU|fair use]], but such a use should be justified on the image description page.

*'''Describe the image.'''
:To another reader, the image may not be immediately understood.  A caption in an article doesn't explain the image to a visitor who sees it on its image page.  Put a brief explanation of what is in the image on the image description page, similar to what you might include in a caption on an article.  

Some links to Wikipedia pages on this subject: 

'''[[Wikipedia:Copyrights#Image guidelines|Copyrights]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags|Copyright tags]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Fair use|Fair use]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Image description page|Image description page]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Granting work into the public domain|Public domain]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion|Images for deletion]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Possibly unfree images|Possibly unfree images]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Copyright problems|Copyright problems]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Uploading images|Uploading images]]'''

Thanks again for your contributions.  If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me at my talk page. [[User:Feydey|feydey]] 19:42, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

An '''anti-submarine missile'''  is a [[standoff missile|standoff]] [[anti-submarine weapon]]. Often a variant of [[anti-ship missile]] designs an anti-submarine systems typically use a [[jet engine|jet]] or [[rocket engine|rocket]] engine, to deliver: an [[explosive material|explosive]] [[warhead]] aimed directly at a [[submarine]]; a [[depth charge]], or;  a homing [[torpedo]] that is carried from a launch ship, or other  platform, to the vicinity of a target.
[[File:Ikara missile.JPG|thumb|right|&lt;small&gt;[[Ikara (missile)|Ikara]], an [[Australia]]n-designed missile used by several navies between the 1960s and 1990s; a [[rocket engine|rocket]]-parachute delivery system carried an [[acoustic torpedo]] up to 10 nautical miles (19 km) after launch. A variant re-designed in the UK and used by the Royal Navy could deliver a [[Nuclear depth bomb|nuclear depth charge]].&lt;/small&gt;]]
[[File:Maille-Braize-14.jpg|thumb|&lt;small&gt;The [[Malafon]], used by the French Navy between 1966 and 1997, used a rocket-assisted glider to carry a torpedo up to 8 nautical miles (13 km) after launch&lt;/small&gt;. ]]

==History==
[[Depth charge]]s were the earliest weapons designed for use by ships against submerged [[submarine]]s. These explosives were initially dropped as the ship moved over the presumed location of a submarine. Before World War II, shipboard [[sonar]] was unable to maintain contact with a submarine at close range. 

Various [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]]-type projectors, including [[hedgehog (weapon)|hedgehog]] and [[squid (weapon)|squid]], were devised during [[World War II]] to allow a ship to maintain sonar contact while lobbing explosive charges toward the submarine.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Terry, and Costello, John ''The Battle of the Atlantic'' (1977) Dial Press {{Listed Invalid ISBN|0-8037-6454-2}} pp.307-308&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the [[Cold War]], [[missile]]s were developed to provide greater range with reduced [[recoil]]. Some missiles and rockets carry [[homing torpedo]]es to provide terminal guidance for the warhead.&lt;ref&gt;Albrecht, Gerhard ''Weyer's Warships of the World'' (1969) United States Naval Institute p.385&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''northern river shark''' or '''New Guinea river shark''' (''Glyphis garricki'') is a [[species]] of [[requiem shark]], in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Requiem shark|Carcharhinidae]] found in scattered [[tidal river]]s and associated coastal waters in northern [[Australia]] and in [[Papua New Guinea]]. This species inhabits areas with poor visibility, soft bottoms, and large [[tide]]s, with immature sharks ranging into [[freshwater|fresh]] and [[brackish water]]. It is similar to other river sharks in having a stocky grey body with a high back, tiny eyes, and broad fins. It measures up to {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} long.

Northern river sharks are likely [[piscivorous]]. This species is [[viviparous]], with females bearing litters of 9 young possibly every other year before the [[wet season]]. Very rare and facing threats from [[commercial fishing|commercial]] and [[recreational fishing]], and perhaps also [[habitat degradation]], this species has been assessed as [[Critically Endangered]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]].

==Taxonomy==
The first known specimens of the northern river shark, two newborn males from Papua New Guinea, were discovered by [[New Zealand]] [[ichthyologist]] [[Jack Garrick]], after whom the species was eventually  named. This shark was referred to as &quot;''Glyphis'' sp. C&quot; until 2008, when it was formally described by [[Leonard Compagno]], William White, and [[Peter R. Last]] in a [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] paper. The [[type specimen]] is a female {{convert|67|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, collected from the [[East Alligator River]], [[Kakadu National Park]], [[Northern Territory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Compagno, L.J.V. |author2=W.T.

==Distribution and habitat==
The northern river shark has been reported from [[King Sound]], the [[Ord River]], and Doctors Creek near [[Derby, Western Australia]], the [[Adelaide River|Adelaide]] and [[Alligator Rivers]] in Australia's [[Northern Territory]], and the [[Daru]] region and possibly the [[Fly River]] in Papua New Guinea. It inhabits large [[river]]s, [[estuaries]], and coastal [[bay]]s, all of which are characterized by high [[turbidity]], silty or muddy bottoms, and large tides. Young and juvenile sharks are found in fresh, brackish, and salt water ([[salinity]] ranging from 2 to 36 ppt), whereas adults have only been found in marine environments.&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pillans et al&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pillans, R.D. |author2=J.D.

==Description==
Like other members of its genus, the northern river shark has a stocky body with a high back. The head is wide and flattened, with a broadly rounded snout and minute eyes equipped with [[nictitating membrane]]s. Each [[nostril]] is divided into a very large incurrent opening and a small excurrent opening by a triangular skin flap. The sizable mouth is broadly arched, with short furrows at the corners. Thirty-one to 34 tooth rows are in the upper jaw and 30&amp;ndash;35 tooth rows are in the lower jaw; the upper teeth are upright and triangular with serrated edges, while the lower teeth are narrower and straight to slightly curved. In the largest individuals, the first few lower teeth from the jaw median are spear-shaped with serrations near the tip.&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;/&gt;

The [[pectoral fin]]s are large and broad, with gently backward-curving margins and pointed tips. The [[pelvic fin]]s are triangular with nearly straight trailing margins. The first [[dorsal fin]] is long-based and triangular, with the apex almost forming a right angle; the second dorsal fin is some two-thirds as high as the first. The origin of the first dorsal fin lies over the pectoral fin insertions, while that of second dorsal fin lies over the pelvic fin rear tips. No ridge exists between the dorsal fins. The [[anal fin]] is smaller than the second dorsal fin and has a strong notch in the rear margin. The [[caudal fin]] has a strong lower lobe and a long, narrow upper lobe with a ventral notch near the tip. The [[dermal denticle]]s are small, oval, and overlapping, bearing three horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth. This shark is steel-gray above and white below; the color transition is sharp, located well below the eye, and becomes jagged on the sides of the trunk. The anal and caudal fins become dusky or black towards the trailing margins and tips. The maximum known length is {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}}. This species differs from the [[speartooth shark]] (''G. glyphis'') in several [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] and [[meristic]] characters, including having fewer [[vertebra]]e (137&amp;ndash;151 versus 213&amp;ndash;222) and a lower, jagged gray-white color boundary.&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;/&gt;

==Biology and ecology==
With its slender teeth, small eyes, and high density of [[ampullae of Lorenzini]], the northern river shark seems to be [[adaptation|adapted]] for hunting [[fish]] in conditions of poor visibility. In Doctors Creek, sharks may move to and from favored feeding areas with the tide.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thorburn, D.C., D.L. Morgan, A.J. Rowland and H.S. Gill. (February 2004). [http://www.environment.gov.au/coasts/publications/pubs/glyphis-wa.pdf The northern river shark (''Glyphis'' sp. C) in Western Australia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108234623/http://environment.gov.au/coasts/publications/pubs/glyphis-wa.pdf |date=8 November 2011 }}. Report to the National Heritage Trust, Murdoch University. Retrieved on 10 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Like other requiem sharks, this species is [[viviparous]], with the developing [[embryo]]s forming a [[placenta]]l connection to their mother after exhausting their supply of [[yolk]]. Females give birth around October, before the start of the [[wet season]], on possibly a biennial cycle. One female examined contained nine [[fetus]]es.&lt;ref name=&quot;pillans et al&quot;/&gt; The young are born at under {{convert|67|cm|in|abbr=on}} long; males [[sexual maturity|mature]] between lengths of {{convert|1.2|and|1.4|m|ft|abbr=on}}, while females mature between lengths of {{convert|1.4|and|1.7|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;/&gt;

==Human interactions==
The northern river shark appears to be extremely rare, though more subpopulations may remain to be discovered in Australia and Papua New Guinea. Based on present information, no more than 250 mature individuals are estimated to exist in the wild, with no more than 50 in any particular subpopulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt; This species is caught legally and illegally by [[commercial fisheries]] using [[longline fishing|longlines]] and [[gillnet]]s, as well as by [[recreational fishing|recreational fishers]]; [[habitat degradation]] may pose a further threat to its survival. Because of its low natural abundance, limited distribution, stringent habitat requirements, and susceptibility to various human-caused threats, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] has assessed the northern river shark as [[critically endangered]]. It has also been listed as endangered on the 1999 Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, and on the 2000 Territory Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act. Kakadu National Park may be an important protected area for this species.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt; No regulations restrict the capture of this species in Papua New Guinea.&lt;ref name=&quot;white et al&quot;/&gt;

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Zoidberg. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Zoidberg~enwiki that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]]. If you think you might own all of the accounts with this name and this message is in error, please visit [[Special:MergeAccount]] to check and attach all of your accounts to prevent them from being renamed.

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== Hare Krishna picture ==

There is a picture of a Hare Krishna procession in the [[Religion_in_Mexico#Buddhism|Buddhism]] section, even with a caption about them being buddhists. Hare Krishnas are not buddhists, they are hindus. The article is semi-protected so I can not correct that myself. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Wenzelkarbovski|Wenzelkarbovski]] ([[User talk:Wenzelkarbovski|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Wenzelkarbovski|contribs]]) 17:39, 22 April 2015 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Self-ascription fallacy ==

''The last census reported, by self-ascription, that over 95% of the population is Christian.''

The so-called self-ascription of the census is nothing but a silly way of measuring data. Obviously they count children as Christians just because their parents say so. This people should either be clear about this or not count children at all. By the way, since a couple of years ago the Catholic Church has started to indoctrinate [[Huichol]] kids. Shame on us, Mexicans. Shame on us... The Huichols were one of the very few indigenous people whose religious tradition haven't been polluted by Catholicism but now the church has started taking advantage of the poverty of this people and the new constitutional reforms to infiltrate to their villages and improvise &quot;schools&quot;. Of course they know that adults wouldn't let themselves be indoctrinated so they choose to attack young minds. Catholicism and ignorance have been the ingredients of our condition as a Third World country.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Scandza|Scandza]] ([[User talk:Scandza|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Scandza|contribs]]) 13:27, 30 May 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;


Can anyone explain why the Evangelical Free Church of America does so many, many missionary trips to Mexico, when it's a predominantly catholic country? I mean, there are definite ideological differences involved, but I wasn't aware the two churches actively tried to convert each other's members.


==First phrase==

Any interest in removing &quot;Unlike some other Latin American countries&quot; from the first sentence of the article? It does not seem to serve any objective purpose and seems slightly antagonistic.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Namenderkrieg|Namenderkrieg]] ([[User talk:Namenderkrieg|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Namenderkrieg|contribs]]) 15:34, 24 March 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Easter==

I'm removing this:

&quot;Some of them however, do not celebrate Easter because they think that the Easter Bunny is the devil. Instead of celebrating Easter, they like to eat Mexican Pizzas.&quot;

because it's obviously untrue and just stupid. I think the article should be rewritten though, by someone more experienced than I am.--[[User:PARCGOP|PARCGOP]] 14:09, 7 April 2007 (UTC)

==Contradiction?==
This article says that 95% of people in Mexico are Roman Catholic.  The Mexico article states that 95% of people are Christian, and only 89% are Roman Catholic.  Which is correct, or am I just confused?
[[User:Yumecosmos|Yumecosmos]] ([[User talk:Yumecosmos|talk]]) 02:20, 9 January 2008 (UTC)

== Rewriting ==

I have imported the Religion section from the article on [[Mexico]] and integrated the information that was only on this article. I also moved around paragraphs and added a subtitle to make reading easier. Finally I removed the stub templates and replaced it with the expand one. --[[User:Marianika|Marianika]] ([[User talk:Marianika|talk]]) 16:32, 19 May 2008 (UTC)

== What about non-believers? ==

What about atheists, agnostics, deists in Mexico? How many Mexicans actually believe in God? Is there any data about that?  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/213.196.243.113|213.196.243.113]] ([[User talk:213.196.243.113|talk]]) 22:41, 27 May 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Mexican Ethnic Religion (Mexicayotl) ==

This article lacks a part about the growing movement of Mexicayotl, or Ethnic Mexican Culture or Religion, which is the revival of &quot;Aztec&quot; religion. --[[Special:Contributions/79.45.49.143|79.45.49.143]] ([[User talk:79.45.49.143|talk]]) 12:47, 16 August 2010 (UTC)

== Typo in Nonreligious section ==

'''John Ralph Ragazzini''' (January 3, 1912&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pnxBAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=John+Ralph+Ragazzini+1912&amp;dq=John+Ralph+Ragazzini+1912&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjC4sew9dPVAhXMHJoKHeWmAFsQ6AEIKzAB Profile of John Ralph Ragazzini]&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; November 22, 1988) was an [[United States|American]] [[electrical engineer]] and a professor of [[Electrical Engineering]]. 

==Biography==
Ragazzini was born in [[Manhattan, New York City]] and received the degrees of B.S. and E.E. at the [[City College of New York]] in 1932 and 1933 and earned the degrees of A.M. and Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at [[Columbia University]] in 1939 and 1941.

Ragazzini was dean of the School of Engineering and Science at [[New York University]] and during [[World War II]] he was chairman of the Department of Electrical Engineering at Columbia University, where he was involved in the [[Manhattan Project]].

Ragazzini's notable students are [[Rudolf E. Kálmán]] (see [[Kalman filter]]s), [[Eliahu Ibraham Jury]] (see [[Z-transform]]), [[Gene F. Franklin]] (see [[digital control]]), and [[Lotfi Asker Zadeh]] (see [[Fuzzy sets]] and [[Fuzzy logic]]).

Ragazzini is also credited, along with Lotfi Zadeh, in 1952, to have pioneered the development of the [[z-transform]] method in [[discrete-time]] [[signal processing]] and analysis.

In 1970 he received the [[Rufus Oldenburger Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asme.org/about-asme/honors-awards/achievement-awards/rufus-oldenburger-medal |title=Rufus Oldenburger Medal |publisher=[[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] |accessdate={{Format date|2013|2|14}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, [[American Automatic Control Council]] named [[John R. Ragazzini Award]] after Ragazzini and he was the first recipient of the award. Ragazzini died on 22 November 1988, aged 76.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/24/obituaries/john-ragazzini-76-educator-and-engineer.html&lt;/ref&gt;

I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under [[Wikipedia:Fair use|fair use]] but there is no [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline|explanation or rationale]] as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags/Fair use|boilerplate fair use template]], you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with [[WP:FU|fair use]].

Please go to [[:Image:Brokeninpieces.jpg|the image description page]] and edit it to include a [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline |fair use rationale]]. Using one of the templates at [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline]] is an easy way to insure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template. Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.

If there is other other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on the other images used on this page.

The '''United Church, Chapel on the Hill''' in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]] was the city's main church during [[World War II]]. Dedicated on September 30, 1943 and completed late in October 1943, it was originally a multi-denominational [[chapel]] shared by [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and [[Judaism|Jewish]] congregations.&lt;ref name=NationalRegister/&gt;&lt;ref name=churchhistory&gt;[http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=category&amp;sectionid=4&amp;id=39&amp;Itemid=55 Church History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728092956/http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=category&amp;sectionid=4&amp;id=39&amp;Itemid=55 |date=July 28, 2011 }}, United Church, Chapel on the Hill website, accessed March 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architectural design ==
The building design is a [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] 700-series [[U.S. Army]] chapel.&lt;ref name=Townsite&gt;[http://oakridgevisitor.com/history/pdf/OriginalTownSites.pdf Chapel on the Hill] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517124718/http://oakridgevisitor.com/history/pdf/OriginalTownSites.pdf |date=May 17, 2008 }} in ''Jackson Square – the original Townsite'', Oak Ridge Convention and Visitors' Bureau&lt;/ref&gt; It is a frame building built on a three-bay rectangular plan with a [[Steeple (architecture)|steeple]]d [[bell tower]] and a [[gable]] entry [[porch]]. It was one of three Army chapels built using the same design in Oak Ridge during World War II. One of the other two chapels, the West Chapel in the city's West Village area, was later torn down, but the East Chapel in the East Village is still in use.&lt;ref name=NationalRegister&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfo.doe.gov/me70/history/NPSweb/Oak_Ridge_Historic_District_(Preferred).pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form for Oak Ridge Historic District |date=July 18, 1991 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829041710/http://www.cfo.doe.gov/me70/history/NPSweb/Oak_Ridge_Historic_District_%28Preferred%29.pdf |archivedate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The U.S. Army built the chapel to house religious activities, as one of numerous community facilities in the &quot;townsite&quot; area of Oak Ridge. The building was dedicated on September 30, 1943, in a ceremony that included [[prayer]]s and talks by a Jewish [[rabbi]], a [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|Catholic priest]], an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] priest, a [[Baptist]] minister, and the [[minister (Christianity)|minister]] who was serving the United Church congregation that eventually came to own the chapel.&lt;ref&gt;Charles W. Johnson and Charles O. Jackson (1981), ''City Behind a Fence: Oak Ridge, Tennessee, 1942-1946''. The University of Tennessee Press. Pages 127-129.&lt;/ref&gt; Its name, &quot;The Chapel on the Hill,&quot; comes from a reference in a prayer by the Knoxville Baptist minister who participated in the dedication.&lt;ref name=Townsite/&gt;

The United Church congregation that is housed in the Chapel on the Hill traces its history to July 18, 1943, when some 25 to 30 Christians of diverse denominational backgrounds gathered for Sunday worship in Oak Ridge's main [[cafeteria]]. Subsequently, several members of the group made plans to establish an interdenominational Protestant church, led by [[laity|layperson]]s, to include all denominations. A [[Presbyterian]] minister working in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] was engaged to conduct weekly services, and about 150 people representing 13 Protestant denominations became charter members of &quot;the United Church&quot;. Governing boards of laypersons elected to lead the new congregation took up their duties on October 24, 1943.&lt;ref name=pre1980&gt;[http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=51&amp;Itemid=55 Pre-1980 Historical Compilation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728093006/http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=51&amp;Itemid=55 |date=July 28, 2011 }}, United Church, Chapel on the Hill website, accessed March 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Chapel-on-the-Hill was completed that same month, the United Church and the local Roman Catholic Church were given control of the building, as the only two churches then officially operating in the [[Manhattan Project]] community. During the war, when Oak Ridge's Manhattan Project facilities were operating around the clock, the chapel building was also in use nearly 24 hours a day as a venue for worship services, [[wedding]]s, and other occasions for local workers of various Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish religious backgrounds.&lt;ref name=pre1980/&gt;

At the peak of wartime activity in Oak Ridge, when the population exceeded 70,000, the United Church employed four ministers and conducted worship services in the Chapel on the Hill, East Village Chapel, and the Jefferson Theater, as well as [[Sunday school]] classes in several local schools and a [[mobile home|trailer]] camp. By 1951, the United Church Chapel-on-the-Hill consolidated as a single [[interdenominational]] congregation, making its home in the Chapel on the Hill building.&lt;ref name=pre1980/&gt;

The United Church congregation purchased the chapel and {{convert|3.72|acre|ha}} of land from the [[U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]] on May 11, 1955 for a price of $17,116.&lt;ref name=pre1980/&gt; An adjoining educational building was added in 1956-1957.

It is felt that the article you created at [[Ethan cavett]] is not suitable for a Wikipedia article, which must have a [[Wikipedia:Notability|notable]] subject and be [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verifiable]]. I have moved it to [[User:{{PAGENAME}}]], which is where users are free to write about themselves. You are at liberty to move it back into the (Main) namespace but bear in mind that if you do so, it is likely to be nominated for deletion. 

Note, however, that the purpose of a user page is to enable active editors of Wikipedia to introduce themselves to other editors. [[WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_a_blog.2C_webspace_provider.2C_or_social_networking_site|Wikipedia is not a general hosting service]], so your user page is not a personal homepage. Content unrelated to Wikipedia or its editing is likely to be removed.

Please see [[WP:User_page|the user page guidelines]], especially [[WP:User_page#What_can_I_not_have_on_my_user_page.3F|this section]] for more information. -- [[User:Omicronpersei8|Omicronpersei8]] ([[User talk:Omicronpersei8|talk]]) 19:36, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

'''Archer''' is a [[slab serif]] typeface designed in 2001 by [[Tobias Frere-Jones]] and [[Jonathan Hoefler]] for use in ''[[Martha Stewart Living]]'' magazine. It was later released by [[Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones]] for commercial licensing.

==Structure==

The typeface is a [[Slab_serif#Geometric_model|geometric]] slab serif, one with a geometric design similar to sans-serif fonts. It takes inspiration from mid-twentieth century designs such as [[Rockwell (typeface)|Rockwell]].

The face is unique for combining the geometric structure of twentieth-century European slab-serifs but imbuing the face with a domestic, less strident tone of voice. [[Ball terminal|Balls]] were added to the upper terminals on letters such as ''C'' and ''G'' to increase its charm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Devroye|first1=Luc|title=Jonathan Hoefler|url=http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-27370.html|publisher=McGill University|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Italic type|Italics]] are true italic designs, with flourishes influenced by calligraphy, an unusual feature for geometric slab serif designs. As with many [[Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones]] designs, it was released in a wide range of weights from hairline to bold, reflecting its design goal as a typeface for complex magazines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Typographica review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Earls|first1=David John|title=Archer|url=http://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/archer/|website=Typographica|accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
The typeface has been used for, among other things, branding for [[Wells Fargo]] and is a main font for the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' and [[Wes Anderson]]'s film ''[[The Grand Budapest Hotel]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=Lauren|title=Is Archer's Use on Target?|url=http://www.aiga.org/is-archers-use-on-target/|publisher=AIGI}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the current font used for titles and body text by the [[Design Observer]] website.

===[[Katisha]]===
Contains no information not in [[The Mikado]] article, the point of the spin-off unclear, as the character only appears in one opera, and it's unclear how this could expand further. In normal circumstances I'd say merge or make it a redirect, but, as I said, everything IS covered in [[The Mikado]], and I can't imagine someone searching for &quot;Katisha&quot;.

*'''Delete''' article per nomination.  Anything notable about this character should appear in the plot summary of ''[[The Mikado]]''.  There is no reason to have a separate article for this character.  -- [[User:Ssilvers|Ssilvers]] 19:59, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Redirect''' it to [[The Mikado]] -- merge isn't needed since the info's there, but the redirect could be useful -- somebody could search for it. -- [[User:ArglebargleIV|ArglebargleIV]] 22:15, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

A tag has been placed on [[:Nonamaker]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article seems to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable [[Wikipedia:Notability|(see the guidelines for notability here)]]. If you can indicate why the subject of this article is notable, you may contest the tagging. To do this, please affix the template &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; to the page and leave a note on [[Talk:Nonamaker|the article's talk page]] explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself.

Please read the [[WP:CSD|criteria for speedy deletion]] (specifically, article #7) and [[Wikipedia:Notability (people)|our general biography criteria]].

== Waterboarding ==

Could you post a link where somebody calls [[surfing]] [[waterboarding]]?  I can't seem to find any. [[User:Jehochman|Jehochman]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Jehochman|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:46, 26 April 2009 (UTC)

Yes, Waterboarding is a very common term in Hawaii, the Western US, Australia and even some former Soviet countries. Here's a link to an article where the author references this http://mydailyclarity.com/2009/03/surfing-for-peace-in-the-gaza/. Also, I found a site that references waterboarding here http://www.hawaiiansouthshore.com/shop/product.php?productid=17375. It get's confusing; I was looking for 'surfing' but we call it Waterboarding so I got to the wrong page ;-)

: Fair enough.  That source uses &quot;water boarding&quot; with a space.  I've made a change to your edit to reflect the space. [[User:Jehochman|Jehochman]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Jehochman|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:23, 26 April 2009 (UTC)</text>

I removed &quot;2006 is only his second full season as a team-manager. It took other team managers, such as [[Frank Williams]] many years to win a grand prix as manager.&quot;

This suggests Fry is responsible for a dramatic turnaround in the team's performance - their 2005 and 2006 performances have been widely acknowledged to have been poor to middling. the circumstances of the Hungarian GP were also exceptional. [[User:Mark83|Mark83]] 19:37, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

::It has been reported in the Telegraph (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/motorsport/formulaone/5369856/Monaco-Grand-Prix-Jenson-Buttons-playboy-days-behind-him.html) that Nick Fry owns a proportion of the team, and in an earlier article, that he owns the majority stake. Shouldn't this be added?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/92.239.225.23|92.239.225.23]] ([[User talk:92.239.225.23|talk]]) 23:17, 28 May 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Klein-Glienicke Schweizerhaus 1.jpg|thumb|320px|''Schweizerhaus'' in [[Klein Glienicke]] near [[Berlin]], designed by [[Ferdinand von Arnim]], 1867]]
'''Swiss chalet style''' ({{lang-de|Schweizerstil}}, {{lang-no|Sveitserstil}}) is an [[architectural style]] of [[Historicism (art)|Late Historicism]], originally inspired by rural [[chalet]]s in [[Switzerland]] and the [[Alps|Alpine]] (mountainous) regions of [[Central Europe]]. The style refers to traditional building designs characterised by widely projecting roofs and facades richly decorated with wooden balconies and carved ornaments. It spread over [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Austria-Hungary]] and [[Scandinavia]] during the ''[[Belle Époque]]'' era.

==History==
[[File:Villa Fridheim, Krøderen, 2.jpg|thumb|Villa Fridheim in [[Krødsherad]], Norway]]
Swiss chalet style originated in the [[German Romanticism|Romantic]] era of the late-18th/early-19th century, when the ideas of the [[English landscape garden]] inspired parks and residences in Germany, such as the [[Dessau-Wörlitz Garden Realm]]. It became highly appreciated on the continent by noble landowners who were impressed by the &quot;simple life&quot; of people living in the mountains. 

The chalet style soon spread over the German ''[[Mittelgebirge]]'' landscapes such as the [[Harz]] mountains or the [[Dresden]] area and the adjacent [[North Bohemia]]n region. As a &quot;modern&quot; building style, it also influenced the [[resort architecture]] along the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] seaside, like in [[Binz]] or [[Heringsdorf, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|Heringsdorf]]. Around 1900, design elements were used in the construction of numerous bourgeois family homes as well as by notable architects like [[Heinrich von Ferstel]] to build larger mansions and hotels. 

The style was further popularized by the first waves of tourism of rich people from the North and West of Europe and became popular in other parts of Europe and North America, notably in the [[architecture of Norway]], [[architecture of Iceland|Iceland]] and [[Architecture of the Netherlands|the Netherlands]] and in the [[country house]] architecture of [[architecture of Sweden|Sweden]] and [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati (Ohio, USA)]], in the late 19th and early 20th century. English examples of the chalet style include the [[Boathouse at Belton House]], [[Lincolnshire]], by [[Anthony Salvin]] and the Swiss Cottage at [[Osbourne House]], on the [[Isle of Wight]], constructed for [[Queen Victoria]]'s children.

==Characteristics==
The style is characterized by:
*[[Gabled roof|Gabled roofs]] with wide [[eaves]]
*Exposed construction beams, including large [[Bracket (architecture)|brackets]]
*Decorative carving and mouldings
*[[Balconies]]
*Large windows
*[[Weatherboarding]], usually painted, often in bright colors

The result was '''delete'''. -- [[User:Jitse Niesen|Jitse Niesen]] ([[User talk:Jitse Niesen|talk]]) 12:28, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

:In case anybody requires an explanation how I arrived at this decision, as it is a bit borderline: There seems to be only one reliable source, an article repeated in USA Today and other media. What tipped the balance is firstly the weak reasons in some of the &quot;keep&quot; comments (specifically, those of necronudist, Portillo, and I don't understand Minfo); and secondly, I think we should be extremely cautious in having articles about living children. -- [[User:Jitse Niesen|Jitse Niesen]] ([[User talk:Jitse Niesen|talk]]) 12:45, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

* '''Delete''' - he's ten years old, for crying out loud. If he makes it as a pro then add him in but not until then. [[User:Qwghlm|Qwghlm]] 20:09, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
**'''Comment''' You can't delete or not delete an article purely based on age. --[[User:Pinkkeith|Pinkkeith]] 20:11, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
***'''Comment''' - the point is that he doesn't meet [[WP:BIO]]. There are thousands of kids with potential; they get articles here when that potential is realised by playing for the first team of a significant club. WP is not a crystal ball. [[User:BlueValour|BlueValour]] 20:53, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
****'''Comment''' Well, that wasn't the point that you made, but it does pass [[WP:BIO]] based on [[WP:GOOGLE]]. There is no crystal ball to this article at all, it is all based on present information and known fact. --[[User:Pinkkeith|Pinkkeith]] 21:00, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
*****'''Comment''' What &quot;known fact?&quot;  There is not a single source cited in the entire article.  I am particularly leery of this becoming another AFD where the article is kept because of references cited in the AFD discussion that never make it into the article thus defeating the entire purpose of this discussion and [[WP:V]].  --[[User:ElKevbo|ElKevbo]] 14:26, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
*We can, however, '''delete''' an article if no reliable sources are provided when challenged under [[WP:V|verifiability policy]].  Pinkkeith, can you point us to featured coverage in mainstream media?  Some of those are needed to let us keep the article.  Being signed to a youth team isn't notable enough to get thousands of other kids their own WP articles.  [[User:Barno|Barno]] 20:39, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
** Here is a [http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/technology/maney/2005-02-01-maney_x.htm USA Today article] on him. In there the writer mentions that he was covered in numerous other newspapers. --[[User:Pinkkeith|Pinkkeith]] 20:43, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
*** - fine but he has achieved nothing in the adult world - the press references are the result of a splendid publicity campaign for his video but that doesn't confer notability. [[User:BlueValour|BlueValour]] 20:57, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
**** That's blatent [[ephebiphobia]]. Reread the article, the entire article is talking about the video and how it made him notable. --[[User:Pinkkeith|Pinkkeith]] 21:01, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

[http://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=%22Jean+Carlos+Chera%22&amp;btnG=Search+Archives&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8 Google News Archive] search yields 74 unique hits- more than enough to qualify as &quot;the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person.&quot; How old the subject is and the method in which he was made notable isn't relevant; the subject meets [[WP:BIO]]. --[[User talk:Rory096|Rory096]] 21:14, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
:*'''Comment''' - most of the content, apart from his birthdate, fails [[WP:V]]. The Ghits mean we can keep the article not that we must. They are all the result of a single video being published on the internet and they have all picked up the same story.

[[User:BlueValour|BlueValour]] 16:58, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''-So he's a child prodigy, that doesn't make him notable.  Some of my friends are amazing at basketball, but they don't have any articles.  As above, if he makes it to the pros (or college, if Brazil has a college league, I dunno), then we can always repost.

*'''Delete'''  When he has played for Manchester United, Arsenal, Porto, Eindhoven or Real Madrid he will have earned his article.  Until then it is worth remembering that, at least in the UK, it would be highly improper for professional clubs to express an interest in a 10 year old, let alone to 'openly court' them.

*'''Delete''' I've reviewed some of these news articles. I can read only the English ones, which are basically the same novelty one-shot story, repeated, or something like the USA today story, which is more about how everyone is famous on the Internet than a biographical source for an article.

Many of the users are very bias against the idea of a 7yr old having its own article or the fact that his only a child prodigy, but indeed we have a child prodigy article. Im definately getting a sense of outright bias and a feeling that many of the voters here are americans. [[portillo]]

*'''Comment''' - I think most of the delete (and some of the keep) votes are completely missing the point. Of course this kid isn't a notable footballer. He is however notable as an internet/media phenomenon. Wikipedia has plenty of articles for such people, as an example go look at [[Mahir Çağrı]]. Then at the bottom of his page have a look at the categories he's placed in. When someone comes to Wikipedia and searches for &quot;that kid i saw clips of on TV&quot; or &quot;that kid my mate sent me videos of&quot; and who's name give 35,000 google hits... He should be here! [[User:Alii h|aLii]] 15:20, 6 November 2006 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' per norm. [[User:Minfo|м info]] 23:03, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - I wonder if there is a misunderstanding here? If you are a child prodigy as a piano player you can play the piano. If you are a child prodigy as a mathematician you can do complicated sums in your head. Here, the kid undoubtedly has unusual ball skills but that doesn't make him a footballer. I also don't see him as a 'internet/media phenomenon' with any longevity - with YouTube such phenonima come and go like snow in the sun. [[User:TerriersFan|TerriersFan]] 00:01, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
:He was born as a YouTube phenomen but now he's known by all of the users above, has google entries and BBC articles. Guys, you wanna delete him, let's do it. Simply there are people who search for him and people who know him, there are many articles on paper magazines about him, but if you are too zealous to keep a 9-years-old top-youngster 'cause &quot;well, dear Watson, it fails WP:BIO =_= ahem&quot; let's do it. Do it and stop arguing bullshits. --[[User:Necronudist|necronudist]] 09:24, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

The '''European Federation of [[Financial Analyst]]s Societies''' ('''EFFAS''')[http://www.effas.com] is the federation of [[financial analyst|analysts]] associations in Europe. EFFAS comprises 27 member societies representing more than 14,000 investment professionals. EFFAS was founded in 1962 and the headquarters is located in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]].

Besides its European training programme CEFA (Certified European Financial Analyst) EFFAS also grants the Certified International Investment Analysts (CIIA) designation, ensuring professional qualification by offering global as well as local market knowledge within its examination structure. As a global designation the exams can be taken in different languages. Through the national member societies EFFAS provides a full range of services for capital market experts.

==CIIA Certification==
EFFAS participates in further developing the [[Certified International Investment Analyst]] (CIIA) examinations, a financial analyst designation recognised globally. Analysts who belong to European analyst associations that are members of EFFAS, are eligible to participate in the final CIIA examination, if they pass the foundation and the national exams, or if they hold the Certified European Financial Analyst diploma (CEFA).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Big Andy, (Andrew Walsh) was born in Louisville, Ky., on Feb. 12, 1978.  His father, Frank Walsh and mother, Marsha Sils were overly delighted to have him, since their first son, Patrick, was a dud.  Big Andy was known through his childhood as being pretty funny.  His brother, not so much.  His parents divorced in 1981, after his father recuperated from emergency brain surgery, after falling through the roof at his work and landing head first on the concrete below.  He continued to work there until he passed away after a 3 year battle with melanoma, in 2006, a week before his 54th birthday.  His mom remarried and had another child, a daughter named Brittani (Gamble).</text>

{{Wikipedia subcat guideline|notability criteria|{{PAGENAME}}|[[WP:NMS]]&lt;br&gt;[[WP:SCIENCE]]}}
--&gt;
{{rejected}}

Ideas related to science are an important part of any comprehensive [[WP:ENC|encyclopedia]].  This guideline and its criteria are intended for use in determining whether a topic is notable due to being a part of or related to science.  The tests in this guideline are intended to be fairly rigirous so that a topic that is acceptable under this guideline can be considered an appropriate part of Wikipedia.  However, the failure of a topic to meet this guideline's criteria does not automatically exclude it, as it may attain notability through [[WP:N]] itself or another of its subsidiary guidelines.

==Notability of topics related to science==

The need for this guideline comes from there being a set of topics which do not fail the test of the [[Wikipedia:No original research|No original research]] policy or the [[Wikipedia:Attribution]] policy but which none the less are not appropriate to Wikipedia because they do have sufficient notability.  Such topics mostly represent new findings and theories, as well as past findings and theories that have failed to gain significant attention in either scientific circles or the public at large (or so far failed to gain said attention).

A key element to understanding this guideline is that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a research publication, and as such Wikipedia does not usurp the usual validation processes of scientific institutions such as [[peer review]], [[scientific consensus]], and academic recognition. Decisions about including or excluding material must always reflect the opinions of outside authorities, not those of Wikipedia editors. Inclusion or exclusion is therefore not a judgement on the validity, importance or accuracy of a scientific contribution, but simply a reflection of the quality and quantity of responses it received inside and outside the [[scientific community]].

This [[WP:N|notability guideline]] derives its relevance from the policies [[WP:NOT|What Wikipedia is not]] (in particular [[WP:NOT#IINFO|Not an indiscriminate collection of information]] and [[WP:NOT#CRYSTALBALL|Not a crystal ball]]), [[WP:NOR|No original research]] and [[WP:NPOV|Neutral point of view]] (in particular [[WP:NPOV#Undue weight|Undue weight]] and [[Wikipedia:Neutral point  of view/FAQ#Pseudoscience|Pseudoscience]]), as well as the guidelines [[Wikipedia:Conflict of interest|Conflict of interest]] and [[WP:AUTO|Autobiography]]. Also of importance are [[WP:V|verifiability]] and [[WP:RS|reliability]] policies.

==Criteria==
=== General ===
In general, a contribution in the field of science is notable enough to merit inclusion in Wikipedia if it meets at least one of the following criteria:

#'''Textbook science.''' There is regular non-incidental mention of the contribution in general or specialized textbooks published by reputable presses.{{ref|1|1}}
#'''Widely cited.''' Papers covering the contribution have been widely cited{{ref|2|2}} in its research field{{ref|3|3}} relative to other papers in the same area. Self-citations, and citations in journals which are not respected within the relevant research field should be excluded.
#'''Press and fiction.''' It is or was well known due to extensive press coverage, or due to being a recurrent theme in notable works of [[fiction]]. In this case the article should make note of this status. A single article on the theory, even if from a major media source such as ''[[New Scientist]]'' or ''[[Scientific American]]'', is not a sufficient criterion.
#'''Historical interest.''' It has historically met any of the above criteria within the scientific community or the culture at large but has since either been [[superseded scientific theory|superseded]], disregarded, or dismissed by the scientific community or the culture at large. The article should make note of the subject's status in this regard.
#'''Popular belief.''' It is or was believed to be true by a significant part of the general population, even if rejected by scientific authorities.

Notable topics which are primarily non-scientific in nature but which contain claims concerning scientific phenomena, should not be handled as scientific.  For example, the ''[[Book of Genesis]]'' itself is primarily covered as a religious scripture rather than as a cosmology. On the other hand, subjects such as [[creationism]] or [[creation science]], which involve a direct conflict between scientific and religious doctrine, are properly evaluated both on a scientific and theological basis. Similarly, subjects purporting to have a scientific basis may be noteworthy primarily on cultural or sociological bases, such as UFOs, which can usefully be discussed from several different perspectives.

:{{Seealso|Wikipedia:Notability (science)/Irrelevant arguments}}

===Scientific terms===
:''See also [[Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms]]
A scientific term is considered notable and worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia if the following can be established:
# A commonly agreed-upon formal or informal definition
# A trajectory of use for the term in the scientific literature from [[WP:RS|reliable]] and [[WP:V|verifiable]] sources
To determine notability it is important to keep in mind that different fields sometimes use the same term to describe different concepts. On the other hand, especially in the early stages of a field, terminology is often not standardized and different terms are used for the same concept. The policy on [[WP:NAME|naming conventions]] gives more information on the choice of the proper term when more than one term is used in the scientific literature.

== Assessing the reliability and relevance of sources ==

Journals from which citations and evidence of notability are obtained are expected to be well known and respected within the relevant research field.  The previous requirement of citation from a peer-reviewed source is not alone sufficient by this requirement.  (Peer review is done just as easily by a fringe science journal as by a leading journal, while [[Nature (journal)|Nature magazine]], one of the most respected [[scientific journals]] in existence, uses editorial as well as  peer review for submissions.)

Textbooks should either be well-known and respected or produced by a reputable scientific publisher (which is most likely the same publisher as one or more respected journals).

Journals from scientific societies of developing countries are occasionally not reliable.  If a finding in such a journal should prove to be of great scientific interest, that finding is often reprinted and/or reported in reliable scientific sources.  In such a case, the original journal article can be cited as a primary source, but its relevance should be backed up by secondary citations in known reliable sources.

For biographical articles and articles on fringe science, there is some loosening of these requirements.  Works by the topic of a biographical article are relevant to the article whether their writing was published in a reliable journal/publisher or not.  Also, the contents of a journal devoted to a fringe science can provide evidence as to the past or current thinking within that fringe field.  However, the fringe science journals cannot provide evidence for the outright notability of the topic.

==Notes==
{{note|1|Note 1}}:  The scientific contribution must have a major entry in the work. A passing mention of the concept is not sufficient. 

{{note|2|Note 2}}:  Citation counts and peer review mechanisms differ vastly between sciences, fields, and subfields, and editors are urged to inform the relevant [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Council/Directory/Science|WikiProject]] about ongoing debates to get expert input. It should also be noted that ''quantity'' of citations is often only a poor approximation of ''quality''.

{{note|3|Note 3}}:  A &quot;research field&quot; indicates an established area of study for which the topic in question is only a part.  A topic cannot be its own research field, nor can it gain notability from being part of a field which is non-notable.

__NOTOC__
===Overview===
After much deliberation of the [[Wikipedia:Danny's contest/Contest entries|contest entries]] the judges have arrived at a decision.

The entries could be broken down into three broad groups... entries that didn't seem to have much, if any, improvement, entries that were a &quot;good try&quot; and a handful of entries that really took the contest to heart and added a lot of interesting and germane references.

===Criteria===
The judges graded on 4 major criteria:
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!Criterion
!Description
!Weight
|-
|'''Number of citations'''
|Just a  raw count of how many were added. This was a good filter to see if the article could make the finalists... only 2 or 3 refs suggested that maybe not so much had been done.  
|(20%)
|-
|'''Complexity of citations'''
|A gauge of the difficulty level of adding them. Were they notes? web cites? book cites? did they use ISBN tagging? were there multiple places that got the same note? Notes ON notes? 
|(30%)
|-
|'''Appropriateness of cites'''
|Were they actually GOOD cites that moved the article forward?
|(20%)  
|-
|'''Overall article improvement'''

|'''[[Battle of Ceresole]]'''
|An important battle in medieval history, part of the [[Italian Wars]] series. Characterised by contemporaries as &quot;marvellously confused&quot; this battle is attractively illustrated with lots of maps and diagrams. One would expect Kyrill as coordinator of [[WP:MILHIST]] to do a good job of improving an article, and Kyrill does not disappoint. A very powerful article about an interesting battle.

|'''[[Theramenes]]'''
|An important general and historical figure of ancient Greece, including participating in an Athenian coup, multiple battles, and a rebellion. He even had notoriety after death. The article is challenging due to a paucity of sources, but Robth found 80+ cites. There also is an innovative organisation of sources into modern and ancient. A very good article based on some painstaking research.

|'''[[Crawford expedition]]'''
|A very understudied but important battle in the [[American Revolution]]. The winning side often tends to ignore battles they lost, and this article was not much more than a single paragraph stub when Kevin went to town on it. It is now profusely illustrated with maps, paintings, tables and diagrams and has grown to 43 Kb. In addition to 88 high quality footnotes, it also has a comprehensive &quot;references&quot; and &quot;for further reading&quot; section, properly separated out. All books have good ISBN links. This article is a real tour de force and shows the power of our encyclopedia well.

That all of these articles were somehow military related was surely coincidence! :)

'''Joe Eubanks''' (born 1975) is an [[United States|American]] [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] best known by the [[ring name]] '''Lobo'''. He wrestled primarily in [[Combat Zone Wrestling]] (CZW), where he won every major championship and was the first inductee into the [[CZW Hall of Fame]] in 2004. He was formerly the CZW Commissioner/Talent Coordinator.&lt;ref name=&quot;Online World of Wrestling&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/040207.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling 5th Anniversary Show February 7, 2004 - Philadelphia, Pennsylvania - ECW Arena|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===1999-2002===
Along with [[Nick Gage]], [[Justice Pain]], and [[Ric Blade]], Lobo was trained by [[John Zandig]] at the CZW Wrestling School and graduated first in the class.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freewebs.com/andy_czw1/history.html CZWHookup : The history of CZW] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210134119/http://www.freewebs.com/andy_czw1/history.html |date=2008-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He became one of the main wrestlers in CZW along with other graduates from the school. In February 1999, Lobo became the second [[CZW Iron Man Championship|Iron Man Champion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Online World of Wrestling&quot;/&gt; He held the title until June when he lost it to Justice Pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/990619.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling - CZW Down in Flames June 19, 1999 - Mantua, NJ |accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two continued wrestling each other and competed in the first ever Cage of Death match at the first ''Cage of Death'' show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/991016.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling - CZW Cage of Death October 16, 1999 - Mantua, NJ|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lobo won the match and regained the title. He would lose this title to [[Matt Prince|Wifebeater]], but regain it one more time the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/000311.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling - CZW March Violence March 11, 2000 - Sewell, NJ|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lobo also challenged for the [[CZW World Heavyweight Championship|CZW Heavyweight Championship]]. He feuded with Zandig for the title and finally beat him in July 2000. He held the title until ''Cage of Death II''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/000909.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling - CZW Cage of Death II....After Dark September 9, 2000 - Sewell, NJ|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that show, Lobo successfully defended the championship against Zandig in the Cage of Death match. Directly following this match, Justice Pain came out and fought Lobo in another Cage of Death match. In the match, Lobo was thrown from the top of the cage to the ground through a table covered in barbed wire. Justice Pain went on to win the match and the title.&lt;ref name=&quot;Online World of Wrestling&quot;/&gt;  After losing the title, Lobo continued feuding with Zandig. This time, the feud was for ownership of CZW. On February 9, 2002, Lobo defeated Zandig to become the new owner of CZW. He held this position until ''Cage of Death IV'' when Zandig defeated him to regain his position as CZW's owner &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/021213.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling December 13, 2002 - Philadelphia, PA - Viking Hall|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2003-present===
He took some time off from CZW following the Cage of Death match. While he was gone, a new group called the Hi-V tried to take over CZW, with Zandig as their main target. Zandig was planning to face the Hi-V at ''Cage of Death V'', but the stable outnumbered his team 6 to 4. At ''Night of Infamy II'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/031115.html|title=Night of Infamy II - November 15, 2003 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lobo made a shocking return to help Zandig and join his team just in time for Cage of Death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/031213.html|title=Cage of Death V December 13, 2003 - Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their team was successful. In February 2004, Lobo became the first inductee to the CZW Hall of Fame. After this, Lobo remained inactive for the following two years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Online World of Wrestling&quot;/&gt;

At [[Cage of Death 7]], [[Zandig]], who had turned on the fans, wanted to run CZW the way they used to. He called out Lobo, who was backstage for the event, and they joined each other along with [[Justice Pain]] and [[Nick Gage]]. They would later call themselves the Forefathers of CZW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/_2006/|title=2006 results

*'''Speedy Delete''' - for blatant advertising.  I waited a bit to see how this one would play out before making a decision, but as much good faith as I normally assume, there is no sticking up for this one.  The article's [[User:Kobius|prime editor]] (and incidentally, the forum admin) removed the AfD tag from the page and does not take kindly to other editors touching 'his' page.  The whole layout of the article is clearly trying to draw viewers into the forums, perhaps to meet the admitted goal of 500,000 posts.  Add these to the issues others have pointed out and there's really no need for further discussion.

The Anizone is a large site and I think if someone wants to find out more about it they come to the best internet dictionary in the world and they research on of the largest best sites. The site has a largely amount of fair people considering it has been hacked three times. The admin accidently remoe it thinking it would be delete and he was not the maker of the page but it was I.

==BBC News Report and the pilot &quot;looking for a good place to crash&quot;==

The BBC article states that the pilot was looking for a good place to put the aircraft down; he missed some park and instead put the aircraft down in an uninhabited area near Stockport city centre. The evidence does not justify this supposition whatsoever. For one thing, the AIB report states that the aircraft was likely uncontrollable after the engines cut out, and might not have been controllable even before then. The first officer died and the captain suffered retrograde amnesia, so we don't know what went on in the cockpit. There isn't the tiniest shred of evidence that the pilot &quot;put the aircraft down&quot; someplace safe. It was likely just coincidence - there are a lot of empty or disused areas around airports and under approach paths (and *that* is often deliberate).

This is such a common urban legend/media foofah. Every time a plane doesn't actually fall out of the sky, some media type comes up and says the pilot was &quot;looking for a place to crash that wouldn't cause injuries on the ground&quot;. I don't blame the Wikipedian who put this in at all, because he/she likely didn't have any sources other than the BBC article. I am blaming the BBC for making a supposition not supported by the facts.

I suppose people want to think that in an emergency the first thing the pilot will do is look for a safe place to crash. It makes them feel less worried about an aircraft crashing into their home, school, or place of business. It ain't necessarily so, though; in fact it almost is never so. Aircraft about to crash are more often than not uncontrollable - that's why they crash. --[[User:Charlene.fic|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot; face=&quot;Matisse ITC&quot;&gt;Charlene&lt;/font&gt;]] 19:40, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

Edited to add: The cause of the accident wasn't &quot;pump failure&quot; (boo, BBC, again). It was a design error in the fuel line. --[[User:Charlene.fic|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot; face=&quot;Matisse ITC&quot;&gt;Charlene&lt;/font&gt;]] 20:02, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

:Apologies. That would have been my factual faux pas. Thank you for correcting my blathering and making this article respectable. :) [[User:Legion89|Legion]] 13:56, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

A second's more flight and the plane would catastrophically have taken the tower off Stockport's fine Town Hall and crashed into the facade of the (then) infirmary opposite the Town Hall, blocking the main road between that runs from Manchester through Stockport to the south - AG, Stockport.

== Additional cause of this crash ==

I remember seeing a BBC program about this crash. It reported on the findings of the inquiry. It said that there was an additional reason for the crash.

Apparently, the engine speeds were shown in the cockpit on two dials, one for each wing. Each dial had two hands, one for each engine and each labelled with the engine number.

This had been serviced, and a mistake had been made so that engine 3 was connected to the hand marked &quot;4&quot;, and engine 4 to hand &quot;3&quot;.

I think it was engine 4 that was starved of fuel. The pilot saw from the dial that engine 3 had stopped, so he switched off / feathered engine 3. Now both engines on the right wing were out. (This would explain why engine 4 was windmilling.)

As part of the investigation, they tried flying a similar aircraft with engines 3 and 4 both out, and discovered that the aircraft could not be flown properly.

Now, I mention all this because it is an interesting story. Also, because I want to apply the moral to setting up a computer cluster. I want to avoid the possibility of one computer failing and a different one being taken out for service by mistake, thereby bringing down the cluster. 

Does anyone know more about this? [[User:Mm67|Mm67]] 11:44, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

==Is [[Wikipedia:Notability (science)]] a consensus guideline?==
Please state your position, '''yes''' or '''no''', explain your position and defend it.  This is not a vote.  [[User:SmokeyJoe|SmokeyJoe]] 10:47, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Yes''' I consider it one, and I'm not sure what objection people have - if there's a problem that needs fixing, let's fix it.  I already refer to it, guideline or not, since it's very useful.  --[[User:Minderbinder|Minderbinder]] 12:38, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Yes''' Not only is it a consensus guideline, it is absolutely vital for Wikipedia to have such a guideline. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 12:51, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Yes''' I certainly support this guideline, what it is trying to do, and how it is trying to achieve it. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:10, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Yes''' We're ready to go into the stage where changes should be discussed here before being implemented in the policy page. ~ [[User:Trialsanderrors|trialsanderrors]] 17:40, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Absolutely''' We've numerous AfDs and arbcom cases which have documented that this is the community's intent. --[[User:EngineerScotty|EngineerScotty]] 17:44, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* I don't see where the proposed criteria add meaningful advice to writters or evaluators, and the preamble/text is way too long to be practical.  Please cite some examples of AfD where this proposal would have ensured an outcome other than what would have been achieved under the current guidelines.  For each of the criteria now listed I belive that proper application of WP:N and WP:ATT would acheive the same results.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 17:54, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
** There is [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Electric universe (concept)]], where this standard helped to refine the arguments that finally got the topic removed.  The aupporters trying to use this guideline to buoy their cause ended up only showing all the more that the article did not belong in Wikipedia.  &lt;br&gt;You are correct that in the end articles that are removed will be so removed (or not) due to policy concerns.  The need for this guideline comes from its ability to focus the debate on the issues that are important in the relevant cases.  In other words, it helps to achieve the &quot;proper application&quot; that you are claiming makes this guideline irrelevant. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 18:22, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
*** EMS, could your purpose be acheived with an essay?  Among the problems with permutations from guidelines and policies is the evolution into redundant and conficting guidance to the point that writers and evaluators become confused and the branches work at cross purposes.  My frequent analogy is the US Tax Code, which has bread several large industries for interpretation and application.  Writing complex rule sets requires great skill and caution. --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 18:34, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
*** On review of the Electric universe (concept) AfD, it appears to be resoundingly rejected with the tools we already have, most convincingly original research and few reliable sources.  This outcome is consistent with other scientific and academic issues which I have seen defeated at AfD. An excellent nomination doesn't hurt either! --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 18:42, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
**** Right now I am wondering what your agenda is here, as this type of opposition usually comes from someone who has lost an AfD in part due to this and the guidelines and is seeking to water down the standards.  One of the factors that helped with the electric universe AfD was the the nominator was also working on this guideline and used its insights in writing the nom.  Beyond that, there is the basic issue of moving beyond &quot;peer review&quot; as a standard for inclusion, a test passed by numerous non-notable articles that I have seen.  Also, I at least have gone to some pains to couch this as a setting standard for inclusions instead of exclusion.  That way, an argument that &quot;X calls for inclusion&quot; renders this guideline moot as a refutation, and so avoids the types of conflicts that in our laws make being a lawyer such a profitable profession. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 19:16, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
***** My agenda is not as you assert, but your question is a fair one, which I will answer.  My agenda is clarity in the grand scheme of notability guidelines, without a specific prejudice to this proposal. Please visit the discussion page for WP:N to see that there are many people expressing concerns over the whole process.  I support the concept of &quot;encyclopedic suitability&quot;, which we call notablility at WP, for lack of a better name.  I also consider myself a moderate inclusionist.  I am a frequent participant in Afd.  You are correct in one respect, that I origninally became involved in AfD and notability, because I saw too many abuses by uninformed editors who were deleting meanigful articles, though not specifically in the field of science.  My interest is in history and sailing.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 19:33, 16 March 2007 (UTC) 
******Might I recommend that your &quot;no&quot; comment seems to be motivated more by a general dislike for [[WP:N]] rather than a specific distaste for this particular guideline. In particular, the motivation behind this guideline was in part due to a charge made during the [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Pseudoscience|Pseudoscience arbitrartion case]] that such a guideline should exist to fend off charges related to whether an idea was notable in a scientific sense. One can argue whether [[WP:N]] should exist or not, but that's not for us to decide here. It is absolutely not true that this guideline is redudant: there is no other place where it is indicated what makes a scientific idea notable for inclusion in the encyclopedia. [[WP:NOR]] doesn't help because &quot;originality&quot; is a vague concept related to heavily to [[WP:V]] and [[WP:COI]] to be useful when people just make random articles about ostensibly scientific subjects they read about online, for example. [[WP:A]] doesn't help because there are scientific ideas which are not notable (the general consensus of the community is that they do not belong in the encyclopedia) which nevertheless are attributable to reliable sources. [[WP:NPOV]] doesn't work because the exclusion criteria at [[WP:NPOV#Undue weight]] is unable to distinguish between majority and minority except by [[WP:CON|consensus]]. That's why this guideline is needed and why it is used. Look at all the pages that link here and tell me that it isn't referred to. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 13:09, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
* No, it's not.  I think the burden of some evidence that this guideline is widely supported and necessary needs to be shown from the supporters.  Right now it's an initiative, a proposal with stable wording.  However, even in the &quot;test cases&quot; that I looked at, it seems that this guideline isn't being referred to, and evaluation of the articles in question isn't done with these guidelines in mind, rather, articles are mainly evaluated from a point of view of adequate sourcing and original research issues, in other words, policies we already have.  (I do think the editors here have reached a reasonably stable consensus, though.  But that doesn't, to me, make a &quot;consensus guideline,&quot; which implies support from the community overall.)[[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:04, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
**The evidence is in the ''What links here'' tool you can access from the toolbox. I think that you may have a hidden agenda here: you tend to be a bit too quick to agree to a supression bias against non-experts in the fields of science. Is this a misplaced concern? --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 13:09, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
***First of all there are over 150 things that link to [[Wikipedia:Notability (science)]], so it's not unreasonable to expect evidence to be actually gathered by someone trying to make a case.  But more, I went to a few of those &quot;what links here&quot; and apparently the only reason they were linked was that trialsanderrors mentioned that the debate was a test case: not people actually referring to the guideline and trying to use it.  Look at the Electric Universe AfD, for instance, which is the best example I've seen of a borderline-notable scientific theory (where this guideline might help).  [[WP:SCIENCE]] was not used as an argument in the debate, even by you, and the arguments that led to it being deleted were not even much along the lines of what is presented here in the guideline, but were according to core Wikipedia policies like [[WP:ATT]], [[WP:OR]] and so on.  Some of the argument is covered here in the introduction, but the &quot;criteria&quot; part played no role and seems to be central to this as a notability guideline.  So, this is what I mean when I say that no evidence has been presented.  What do YOU mean when you say this is a consensus guideline?  [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:43, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
****The criteria part played a huge role. The only criteria that EU could have come close to satisfying was recognition in popular culture/outside media and we showed that it was not notable along those lines. The guidelines at the time were being formulated and weren't as clear as they are now, but thanks to discussions such as that AfD we have a clearer demarcation. I think you need to read through the AfD we reference again and look carefully at how the criteria line-up with the criteria outlined in this guideline. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:02, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
*****Could you show me precisely where?  I don't mean to be dense, but I really don't see it.  I see your point #5 in the nomination, but that sounds like the core [[WP:N]] argument, and not related to the criteria here.  And anyway, saying the the EU debate influenced [[WP:SCIENCE]] kind of precludes that the EU debate can be thought of as evidence that this is a consensus guideline.  Can you show me ANY AfD debate that explicitly references the criteria?  [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:17, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
******Number 5 in the nomination. While it doesn't explicitly reference this page, it does so implicitly (and if I recall correctly at the time the standards were still being developed as to which criteria were going to be grouped with which). --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:20, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
*******Again, #5 was really along the lines of basic [[WP:N]].  Again, show me any debates that explicitly reference the criteria.  There's a difference between this proposal being wise or balanced or sensible and it having ''broad community support.''  [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:44, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
********Basic [[WP:N]]&quot;? That's a bit of WikiLawyering I haven't come across before. The fact is that #5 has direct parallels to our criteria here. You can thrust your head in the sand over this all you want, but that's the plain truth of the matter. And now you reposition your attack to claim that there isn't &quot;broad community support&quot;, but let me remind you that arbcomm members entreatied the community to develop these standards in the first place and that by virtue of this being a Wiki it will end up as balanced and sensible as possible. I'm beginning to think you are being a stick-in-the-mud for reasons you aren't coming clean about. Help me out, explain to me why you always seem to be fighting against scientific accuracy at Wikipedia so I can [[WP:AGF|assume good faith]] towards your contributions. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 17:36, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
***I suggest you go read [[WP:AGF]] and actually take it to heart.  In our current discussion, you seem to have trouble differentiating between (1) my personal support or opposition of the proposal and (2) my arguing that the proposal isn't a &quot;consensus guideline&quot;, that is, that it doesn't have broad support.  This wouldn't be a very hard difference to understand if you had been assuming good faith of me in the first place.  For the record, I support some of what the proposal says but not all of it, but that wasn't the basis for my objections: calling the proposal a &quot;consensus guideline&quot; is wrong, because this is still a very new proposal, barely even stable enough to judge.  [[WP:PROF]] remained a proposal for a very long time, and finally became a guideline when it became apparent that the guideline had influenced the way decisions were being made, and that the community, de facto, embraced the guideline.  Creation of policies and guidelines is slow and for good reason, especially when actionable changes are being proposed (like the criteria here).

****I appreciate your candor regarding your opinions of the content of this guideline because that is precisely what concerns me. However, I do feel that you are being a bit oblique in your commentary. &quot;Policy creation is slow,&quot; is often the cry of those who want to slow things down, and people tend to drag their feet for a reason. To me and many of the other editors who commented above, this guideline is ''de facto'' in place and isn't a proposal because we as editors abide by it. As you know, Wikipedia policies and guidelines are not written to affect change in the encyclopedia, but rather are meant to describe what actively goes on in editing. A good number of those who say that this is a consensus guideline edit a lot of science-related articles and so should be the ones to tell whether or not this guideline applies. I don't see that you are actively doing this as such. I do see you stepping into disputes regarding science-related articles often, and there are many times I see these actions as being in something of a contravention of the guidelines outlined here. I am being very up-front about my distrust of your motivations, but in so doing I'm also trying to assume good-faith as much as I can. Part of assuming good-faith is being transparent about one's perceptions and I'm offering you the opportunity to explain yourself as transparently as possible so we can move on. I don't like being lectured about [[WP:AGF]] when I was the one who brought it up, it looks to me like you are asking me to turn a blind eye towards our long history here at the encyclopedia and I am honestly telling you I'm having a hard time doing it because of the nature of this particular dispute we're having. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 13:53, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
*****You are making false implications about me, and I want it to stop.  [[WP:CIV|Comment on my comments]].  You say this is an attempt to document how Wikipedia works?  I respectfully disagree -- this talk page and its archives are full of debates about what the criteria ''should'' be, with very little discussion or analysis of how things are actually decided now.  (Some, but not much.)  From perusing the test cases, it seems to me that people are nearly exclusively deciding on these cases on the basis of [[WP:OR]], [[WP:ATT]], and [[WP:NPOV]], (and to a degree, [[WP:N]]), without much need for arguments specific to issue that the topics under discussion are scientific ones.  Since that ''isn't'' the content of this proposal, I cannot agree that this is documenting current Wikipedia practice, but if you want to try to change my mind, please show me specific examples so we can discuss them.  In any case, you should advertise this debate on [[WP:VPR]]; the general Wikipedia community should have a chance to comment.

******Whether they are false or not, they are simply my questions regarding your, frankly, obstinate resistance to this particular document. I am trying to be as forthright as possible here, and your increasingly haughty responses only confuse me further since you still haven't addressed directly my concerns regarding the history we have surrounding issues such as this. I disagree that the discussions are centering around how things &quot;should&quot; be. Rather I see discussions centering around generalizing from the experience that editors have. You also seem to be under the opinion that just because people reference older and more established policies and guidelines they aren't also considering this guideline. This I find to be particularly problematic because it ignores the words of people that aren't appended with a WP-acronym. Just because somebody doesn't cite this directly doesn't mean that you can't see the criteria being applied (as per our earlier discussion on EU deletion). I would hope that you would look more closely at the deletion discussions surrounding this and see if you can't spot the criteria in action. I am not going to advertise the debate anywhere, but you are free to do so. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 16:27, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
*******I've advertised the debate at [[WP:VPR]].  In terms of the status: you see one thing, I see another thing.  I'm not going to change my opinion by simply being told &quot;please look more closely,&quot; although you could convince me if you actually showed me some evidence.  I do see a lot of attempts at guiding the community: take a look at [[#&quot;Conference topic&quot; is a backdoor]], for instance, or [[#One final thought]]: people are discussing how to make a good rule, not what the rule is, organically.

****I'm with SA here: [[WP:N]] is being criticized partly because of its extreme generality.  No reason to think the entire idea of notability for all topics must pause just because of that.

****  The problem lies less with any individual sub-guideline, but more with a plethora of permutations leading to confusion.

***** I don't see any bedlam here.  I see this as being a well crafted guideline that is dealing with issues which are out-of-scope for the more general guideline due to its broad nature.  This guideline deals with the issues of science and science-related topics, and how to implement the notability guidelines within that context.&lt;br&gt;I have looked at the [[WP:N]] discussion and I get the feeling that you are doing your best to create uncertainty and confusion there.  And now you are trying to do the same here.  I for one have no need for it, and support this guideline as a reflection of the legitimate sense of the science editors here as to what is valid. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 18:23, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
*Yes, this appears to be a consensus guideline. The opposition to this guideline proposal may be part of a campaign in which User:Kevin Murray in the past month has placed &quot;rejected&quot; , &quot;disputed&quot; , or &quot;historical&quot; , or &quot;essay&quot; labels on about a dozen notability proposals or guidelines or has nominated them for deletion on the grounds that there was no consensus or that they constituted &quot;instruction creep&quot; or were redundant. A proposal is not necessarily impossible to reach consensus upon just because a few editors oppose it.

** I see your point.  This editor really, really has a grudge against the concept of notability, and I would love to know why.  If you want to do a [[WP:RfC]] against him, I am will be happy to second it.  This is ridiculous. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 19:42, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
*** No EMS, this editor, has a &quot;grudge&quot; against needless and redundant rule making for the sake of rule making.  I strongly support the concept of encyclopedic suitability which we call &quot;notability&quot; at WP.  This is not &quot;ridiculous&quot; but based on observations from life experience, that too many conficting rules create confusion rather than clarity.  Complex rule-sets require incredible cross coordination among the permutations, which is not happening here at WP, as guidelines are multiplying like rabbits without consideration of the big picture.  If you propose an RfC, please do so in the best interest of WP, not &quot;against&quot; me; this is not personal and reviewing the discussions will reveal that my actions are well supported.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 14:18, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
****There are plenty of Wikipedians who [[WP:IAR|agree with you about hating rules]]. However, might I suggest that you are going about it the wrong way. We are here writing this guideline because we need to summarize what has been done in regards to this issue. Your own personal distaste for the way in which editors have gone about doing this is probably best argued elsewhere: it certainly has nothing to do with whether consensus exists for this particular guideline. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:29, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
*** I do not see '''any''' need to coordinate this guideline with any other guidelines beside [[WP:N]] itself.  Although I am doing my own &quot;[[WP:NOR|original research]]&quot;, I have seem enough -uh- &quot;stuff&quot; offered by others such that I see a need to draw a firm and reasonable as to what is and is not acceptable here.  Until it has some reasonable amount of recognition in the scientific community, I see an article on my ideas as being an abuse of Wikipedia.  Yet I am unusual in that most other editors of Wikipedia with alternate ideas are here to promote those ideas, and they hate guidelines like this one with a purple passion because they help to keep their OR out.&lt;br&gt;BTW - I do see where you have had some success with you anti-Notability campaign.  Personally I think that you are doing Wikipedia a real disservice with it, and what you are stifling is not a bunch useless rule-making but instead needed elaborations on the meaning of Notability in various domains.  As has been noted in [[Wikipedia_talk:Notability|the WP:N discussion]], there is a level of subjectiveness in determining notability.  The need for these subsidary guidelines is to limit that subjectiveness, and thereby make this concept more usable.  Instead you are trying to pull the rug out from under Notability, something that will make the removal of questionable material much more difficult than it should be. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 16:08, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''the real test''' is whether the guidelines here will be accepted in practice. Both the above positions are to some degree correct: the guideline should reflect what its eds. believe to be the common feeling of the community, but it shouldalso point in the direction of where the consensus appears to be moving, and to be making recommendations from those most involved in edited these articles to guide thos less familiar. I think it will prove to be accepted because it is relatively straightforward, not complex -- at least by comparison -- and, in my view it does reflect the general voice. But we shall see. 
::The real dispute , I think, is over the notability of fringe science and whether that can be considered science in any sense at all. This is a matter in which I think there is in fact no real consensus, but at best a temporary majority, and i expect this  question to continue to be the theme of AfDs. I don't think this guideline  lays it to rest '''[[User:DGG|DGG]]''' 23:36, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
::: This guideline cannot and should not judge whether something is &quot;real science&quot;.  In fact, all that a determination that something is &quot;not science&quot; can do here is to remove a topic from being judged by this criteria with no resolution on its notability or lack thereof.  IMO, we have a set of criteria here such that anything that is meant to be judged as part of science can be ruled on here, be it mainstream or fringe.  What I think that you will find is that the least palatable topics are those which also have had the least impact and are also therefore the least notable.  --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 01:53, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

== Some suggestions on organizing this project page ==

* The introduction is too long.  Limit it to &quot;what&quot; and &quot;why&quot;.  Get the commentary (i.e. &quot;impetus&quot;) and discussion of process into its own section.  Specifically address what makes ''science'' different from other areas covered by the general guidelines.
* Criteria should define at least these categories as guidance to editors:
** topics which on their face should be include (i.e. the notable)
** topics which are going to require some judgments to be made by editors if they are new articles or added to existing articles. (i.e. the maybe notable)
** topics which, at least according to the authors of the guideline, are ''improbably'' included. (i.e. nonnotable)
* The statement ''&quot;Decisions about including or excluding material must always reflect the opinions of outside authorities, not those of Wikipedia editors.&quot;'' is bizarre because the opinion of Wikipedia editors is what, by definition, compose the Wikipedia. ''&quot;Must always&quot;'' is a rather strange term to be found in a mere ''guideline'' at any rate. [[User:Patsw|patsw]] 13:22, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

:: If you wish to draft an alternate version, the feel free to do so ''elsewhere'' and present it to us as a possible replacement.  We are certainly amenable to productive changes.  However, IMO the current project page works and should be considered a functioning guideline. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:13, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
:I agree the ''reflect outside authorities'' wording is odd (although not any odder than &quot;notability is not subjective&quot; which expresses the [[WP:ATT|same sentiment]]). The rest doesn't strike me as an improvement. ~ [[User:Trialsanderrors|trialsanderrors]] 17:49, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

::One point that isn't being made (in the intro) and probably should be is the point that scientific theories cannot be properly presented without understanding their level of acceptance.  There's a big difference between a mainstream theory and a fringe theory, and even in an article about a fringe theory, it's important to describe it as one.  However, for some fringe theories, insufficient sources exist to back up the claim that they are fringe theories.  Thus we are left with only one real choice: disallow the article, as we cannot properly cover it while adhering to [[WP:ATT]] and [[WP:NPOV]].  This is different from, say, an article about a band, where it may be that no source reports on their popularity or number of fans accurately, but sources do report on other things: the information we can't cover can just be left out.  In articles on science, we really can't leave that out.  [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:41, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

:::The &quot;level of acceptance&quot; argument makes no sense to me. &quot;Theory&quot; in science has a very precise meaning which applies to models and descriptions which are as completely accepted as possible in an endeavor based primarily on the dubious activity of inductive reasoning. While there is a big difference between mainstream and fringe proposals, the proposals themselves are only considered &quot;theories&quot; when they pass the tests of the scientific method. What makes a proposal fringe is, ostensibly, its inability to pass these tests. This doesn't mean that scientists don't make mistakes in pejoratively labeling the fringe out of the mainstream, only to say that the level of acceptance is something of a binary operator: either it's in or it's out. When an idea does not generate enough interest in the scientific community to create commentary from members of the community, it must either be uncontroversial (as is the case with textbook knowledge) or it must be outside the scientific community. This is quite easy to verify. No amount of posturing and insisting on the part of a fringe idea's proponents that the idea is actually &quot;scientific&quot; is good enough when demarcating for our purposes. We might still have articles on the idea if there is &quot;extra-scientific&quot; interest in it, but we do not need to shy away from being honest about its &quot;extra-scientific&quot; nature. One of the problems that many pro-fringe editors have is that they believe that because [[negative proof|proving the negative]] is in principle a defiance of [[WP:ATT]] that reasonable editors can't make editorial judgments with regards to the status of a particular idea. This is simply not the case at all: we are editing an encyclopedia not compiling a list of sources. After all, that's why we have editors in the first place: we are charged with summarizing the available data in the most conformist way possible. When all the data is outside the scientific community and the idea purports to have scientific importance, it is perfectly fine to delineate the contradiction. However, this discussion is probably better suited for [[WP:FRINGE]]. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:09, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

*I think it is a little more complicated than that.
*It is not ''necessary'' to give an indication of the acceptance of a theory, in order to describe it.
*And I don't think the word &quot;theory&quot; has such a precise meaning as scientists would like. For example, Wikipedia calls the [[Big Bang]] a &quot;theory&quot;, whereas the Encyclopedia Britannic calls it a &quot;Model&quot;. And I am sure there are more sources supporting both.
*This is why the new [[WP:A]] is so important. I can attribute both the Big Bang Theory, and the Big Bang Model, but I can find no source which agues it must be one or the other.
*I can also find no attribution labelling many minority subjects as &quot;fringe&quot;, nor claiming a certain level of acceptance. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 17:47, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

== Making this an approved guideline ==

I notice that Kevin Murray has downgraded this guideline back to the &quot;proposed&quot; status.  I would revert that myself, except that I am not at all clear by what action/authority it became considered a functioning guideline.  Certainly the above poll has produced only five people who support this as a guideline.  Even without the two nay-sayers I fail to see how the five of us constitute a group that can speak for the Wikipedia community as a whole, or at least the science editors.

I for one do call for the issue of approving this as a functioning guideline be presented to the community as a whole.  [[Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)|the Village Pump policy forum]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Science|WikiProject Science]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Physics|WikiProject Physics]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Chemistry|WikiProject Chemistry]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Biology|WikiProject Biology]] are all places where this guideline can be advertised and input and approval sought.  I see little danger in this and much promise, but mostly I would like to be able to show Kevin a formal approval so that is downgrading of this guideline cannot occur again. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 02:17, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

::We don't do &quot;formal&quot; and &quot;official&quot; with respect to guidelines. What matters is if this is (1) a good idea and (2) used as such in practice.

Judged by this talk page and AFD, the answer to all three is 'yes', so this page is a de facto guideline and Kevin is the lone dissenter here. Of course, putting a notice on the village pump never hurts.

:::Kevin is not the only dissenter, I also am.  Let me enumerate some general criticisms, this time relating to the substance of the proposal.  1.  There is not a big need for this.  Most science articles up for deletion are up for other concerns than notability, primarily, concerns that the article is original research, POV, or inadequately sourced.  Although there are many debates on the test pages subpage, in very few was the critical issue the notability of the subject: [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Electric universe (concept)]], [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Socionomics]], and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Growing Earth Theory]] (and the old debates, not listed there, about [[Time Cube]]).  2.  The list of criteria, a core part of this proposal, were not used as the basis of successful arguments in any of the key examples I listed.  Rather, the test seems to be the general one of being covered in multiple independent sources, inside or outside of the scientific community.  Note that the criteria give an opportunity to supporters of OR articles (real OR, not neutral attempts at describing published research) to argue for inclusion inappropriately: see [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sorce theory]] as an example of this.  The criteria have changed since then, but the same kind of argument could be made today.  I wouldn't want to jeopardize any of those debates by having a guideline here with such minimal applicability.  3.  The list of criteria is instruction creep and isn't useful.  For articles that should be deleted, not meeting the criteria doesn't make a strong argument.  For articles that should be kept, they're okay, but arguments to delete things that meet these criteria are weak delete arguments in the first place, usually along the lines of &quot;this article is in bad shape&quot;, see [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ubiquitous computing]] for example.  The criteria seem aimed at solving a non-existant problem of the over-deletion of notable science topics.

*The fundamental flaw of [[WP:SCIENCE|Notability (science)]], is that it tries to determine only whether an article is '''scientifically''' notable. It does not consider whether an article may be notable in '''any''' other area.

*: This is a true red herring IMO.  A failure of scientific notability does not mean that an article may have notability in another manner and therefore be worthy of inclusion.  I did have wording here to that effect at one time, but it seems to have been lost.  I will see to restoring that, as I see this guideline as being usable only as a means of inclusion.  For the purposes of exclusion, the failure of a topic to merit inclusion under any guideline (including this one) is the relevant matter. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:27, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
*:  (Edit conflict) Agree with EMS; The page clearly embraces the idea that popular notability for science topics is appropriate.  Since popular notability definitely is acceptable (see the [[Time Cube]] precedent, for instance), any wording that implies otherwise should be examined.  But you aren't correctly representing the main thrust of the proposal.

::*I did not suggest that failing scientific notability means that an article MUST be notable elsewhere. I wrote that it MAY be notable elsewhere. Yet the current policy does not consider this.
::*Deleting articles based on scientific notability alone, is an incredible conceit, and should play no part of the proposed guidelines. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 17:35, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
:::*I'm not sure what your point is.  If an article is scientifically notable, fine, it's keepable.  If an article is not notable scientifically, but notable in some other way (for example, in popular culture), fine, it's keepable.  But if the article is not notable in any way at all, why should it be kept?

::::*A number of articles have already been deleted, based on whether they were scientifically notable only, or worse, ''mainstream'' scientifically notable.

:::::* So what?  I see this as something that can and should happen.  If no other grounds are being offerred to justify notability, then the article should go.  I would point out that the deleted items cited as being &quot;non-mainstream&quot; are also considered &quot;non-notable&quot;, while other items have been kept as being &quot;notable&quot; but &quot;fringe&quot;.  It seems to me that this shows that this is a reasonable and workable scheme. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 22:09, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

::::::*No other grounds for notability are offered because the articles are considered only as to whether they are scientifically notable.
::::::*For example, the article on [[Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Ralph_Juergens|Ralph Juergens was deleted]] (a) based on a Scientific notability &quot;test case&quot; (b) on the grounds that he was a &quot;non-notable non-mainstream scientist&quot;, which is accurate, but no cause for deletion by itself.
::::::*It is improper for &quot;Notability (science)&quot; to '''solely''' judge any article for deletion, as it makes no attempt to attract expert editors in other fields --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 23:12, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

:::::::* If you are saying that a deleted article had another non-scince reason for being notable, then please name it and indicate why that reason was not considered at the time.  Also do note that in such cases a request for reconsideration can be made to [[Wikipedia:Deletion review]].  However, this standard is for determining notability with respect to science, and I find it to be quite silly and disingenuous to accuse this guideline of not doing something that it is not meant to so (namely seeking non-science-related reasons for inclusion). --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 01:56, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

::::::::* Ian, I hear you.  However your objections are ''way'' off base here, because what you don't like is that a consensus of Wikipedia editors has disagreed with your stance on certain topics.  That doesn't really have any bearing on whether or not that consensus exists.  You talk like [[WP:SCIENCE]] got Ralph Juergens deleted: no.  A consensus of editors and a discussion got it deleted, and frankly, it wasn't even based on [[WP:SCIENCE]] at all, more like on [[WP:BIO]] or [[WP:PROF]].

:::::::::*No, I am criticizing the make-up of the consensus, which is predominantly science-oriented editors who decided that Ralph Juergens was not notable because he was not a mainstream scientists; That is what the summary says. The AfD was not targeted outside of Notability (Science).
:::::::::*The main reason given for deletion of &quot;Ralph Juergens&quot; was that he &quot;is only published by vanity presses&quot;; not only is this false, but it fails civility guidelines,[[WP:COI#Importance_of_civility]]. Nevertheless, this was picked up by several other editors as their reasons for supporting the AfD.
:::::::::*But this is not the place to discuss a single article, but I offer this as an example. 
:::::::::*I think it is wholly inappropriate for WP:SCI to advertise articles for deletion. WP:NOTABLE should advertise AfD, giving a editors a chance to refer to WP:SCI and OTHER notability guidelines. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 10:46, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

==One researcher POV fails NPOV==
*The third paragraph includes an incorrect statement:
:&quot;the point of view of one researcher or research term and, unless it generates a significant outside response by the scientific community or the population at large, fails NPOV&quot;
*This is a complete misunderstanding of [[WP:NPOV|NPOV]]. If we attribute a statement to a single researcher, and it conforms to [[WP:A]] and is not misrepresented, then it conforms to NPOV. The argument is whether a statement by a single researchers is ''notable'', which is completely different. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 19:26, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

::*If another attributable view is available, we describe it. If it isn't, we don't pretend there might be one. There is no double whammy.
::*Describing the POV of one person does not automatically fail NPOV, and any decent editor can describe any POV in way that fulfils NPOV.
::*Quashing a POV on the grounds that there MIGHT be a hypothetical counter-POV, fails NPOV, fails WP:A, and fails WP:V. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 00:08, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

:::::*The only requirement to provide a balanced view, is if one exists. If it doesn't, then to pretend that a view &quot;needs balancing&quot;, is presumably based on the view of an unattributable, anonymous, expert-less editor. This fails numerous Wikipedia policies.

:::::*Yet both POVs are EQUALLY valid, as long as they are not misrepresented, and can easily be described in a manner that conforms to NPOV. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 13:15, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

:::::::What you fail to realize is that there is an informal community discussion as well as a formal publication discussion. Those who are in a particular community are aware of the informal discussion and are able to tell when a topic is ignored/scoffed or when it is accepted. This cannot be reported at Wikipedia for verifiability reasons, but it still raises NPOV concerns when certain editors try to force obscure research into the forefront of an article. You are mistaking a standard of verifiability (which is the standard for how to write an article) with editorial judgement: they need not be one-in-the-same. In other words, one need not &quot;verify&quot; that there is NPOV issues because, as editors, our editorial opinions do not need to be (nor can they be) verified. The only thing that needs to be verifiable is the text of the article. We are allowed to have judgements that are external to this. As such, it is perfectly reasonable to say that there are NPOV problems with someone citing a single, isolated, though published research paper. In terms of your dark matter red herring, you have totally misconstrued the situation, and I'm fairly confident that nearly any third party not firmly ensconced in pathological skepticism toward mainstream astrophysics would find your evaluation predictably myopic. Clowe's triumphalist attitude is only justified from the standpoint of [[standing on the shoulders of giants]]. It's not like he was publishing his &quot;proof&quot; of dark matter in a vacuum -- it was a particular point that was addressed to a particular (MOND-type) objection. However, when your hypothetical John Doe bucks the established research by publishing proof against dark matter, he is publishing in a vacuum. Prof. John Doe's work is marginal and therefore marginalized by Wikipedia. Clowe's work is mainstream and therefore reported by Wikipedia. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:47, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
::::::::SA is quite right about verifiability vs. editorial judgement.  However, I have to say I worry when editorial judgement of this type comes into dispute.  Wikipedia needs sources for two reasons: one is to have attributions in the articles, but another reason is that it levels the playing field in editorial discussions.  Inherently, experts on Wikipedia are not set above ordinary editors, but they may be more familiar with the subject in question.  But experts have to prove themselves, just like anyone else.  Fundamentally, Wikipedia is a community of equal editors.  So, this is a good argument ''for'' [[WP:SCIENCE]]: in order to avoid having to rely on editorial judgement too heavily, we look for a higher standard of quality in sources for scientific topics, and where that doesn't exist, we should avoid covering the subject.

:::::::::*Let's not mix up NPOV and editorial judgment. As I said earlier, the statement in the introduction is incorrect concerning NPOV. I also said it may concern notability, so I'm not dismissing the point. But let's be accurate as editors.
:::::::::*The idea that a community has informal discussions which a particular editor may be aware, is worthless. It is not verifiable, nor attributable. 
:::::::::*I know THREE different communities, all of whom have informal discussions, and promise peer reviewed papers that I could mention too. Also worthless.
:::::::::*An encyclopedia does not run on material gleaned from Chinese whispers via anonymous, unaccountable editors.
:::::::::*I had previously brought this up at the Neutrality Project, see &quot;[[Wikipedia_talk:Neutrality_Project#NPOV_misunderstanding|NPOV misunderstanding]]&quot;. They agree. A singular POV can be described in an NPOV manner. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 16:01, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

NPOV is inherently based in editorial judgement. The only way that someone determines whether there is a problem with NPOV is by making an editorial judgement. That's why the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{POV}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag comes with the wording it does. Disputes arise between editors over NPOV: if there was a singular editor there would never be NPOV issues from the standpoint of writing an article. While I agree with Mangojuice that editors are judged external to their status as &quot;experts&quot; (see ongoing conflicts over [[WP:EXPERT]] for example), the community doesn't deny the existence of experts either. No one is saying that the encyclopedia should be &quot;run&quot; on expert judgement or the whispers of whatever anonymous and unaccountable ethnic group, but people are saying that editors may come to the table with these concerns. That's the essence of the NPOV guideline: all the points-of-view are placed on the table and the marginalization happens per the outside community and references to the outside world. No one is saying that a singular POV cannot be described, but people are saying that singular POVs present unique difficulties when writing an encyclopedia that is supposed to be NPOV. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 17:39, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

:*Indeed, all the POVs are placed on the table. And if there is just one POV (because there is one WP:V/WP:RS/WP:A), then we can still write that POV so that it conforms to NPOV, regardless of whether you or I or anyone else agrees with the POV, and regardless of whether it is mainstream of pseudoscience.
:*In which case, the statement in the third paragraph that I described above, is incorrect. A view from a single researcher may fail a criteria, but there is no reason for it to fail NPOV; and if it does, any decent editor can re-write it so that it conforms to NPOV. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 19:19, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
:::If there is only one notable POV, then sure, we write about it. In which case the statement in the third paragraph is correct. A view from a single research written about on Wikipedia does have editorial issues related to NPOV for the reasons delineated because the alternatives may exist but cannot be included without falling into original research. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 19:23, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
::::*The statement is incorrect because a single POV does not fail NPOV unless it is written badly, in which case any competent editor can correct it. Sure, the statement may be allowed because it is notable. But it won't fail because of NPOV.
::::*A single POV that has been published elsewhere does not not fail &quot;Original research&quot;, because [[WP:NOR]] &quot;refers to '''unpublished''' facts&quot;. (my emphasis) --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 19:51, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

You are missing the point. Perhaps I should post here the statement that you dispute:

:''Research published in a reputable publication passes these thresholds but reflects the point of view of one researcher or research term and, unless it generates a significant outside response by the scientific community or the population at large, focusing on such research in a Wikipedia article does not adequately conform to [[WP:NPOV|Wikipedia's policy on neutrality]], in particular the section on [[WP:NPOV#Undue weight|undue weight]].''

You'll note that the point being made is that simply quoting published work is not good enough. Why isn't it good enough? Because unless the work in question has generated discussion it has not been vetted outside of Wikipedia to make it possible to write an article on the subject that adheres to the spirit and letter of NPOV.
--[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 20:36, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
::The POV of a single researcher in a single first-rate peer-reviewed publication, has normally been assessed by 2 or usually 3 independent scientists with a tendency to be ciritical. The assumption made by colleagues it that such results are correct unless proven otherwise. Are we supposed to be more critical of physics that he physicists who review for PRL? Then, if discussed by independent sources, as most scientific papers are, it is considered worth citing and commenting one. Reputable journals expect items listed as references to be relevant to the new work also. I'm a librarian. i think many articles in most library journals are basically trivial if not junk altogether.. But they are considered valuable by my colleagues in general, and its their trms that matter. I will judge by reporting theirs',  not imposing my own.'''[[User:DGG|DGG]]''' 09:02, 9 April 2007 (UTC)

:The statement which I quoted above, is as follows:
::&quot;the point of view of one researcher or research term and, unless it generates a significant outside response by the scientific community or the population at large, fails NPOV&quot;
:A single POV may fail, or being accepted by some other criteria. But a single POV does not fail NPOV (unless an editor writes poorly). 
:*To suggest that a statement based on a single POV, changes it's NPOV standing, depending on some other ''potential'' discussion whose view is yet to be determined, is illogical. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 20:46, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

If your point is that someone can attribute a single point of view in a fashion that is NPOV, that is absolutely correct. However, not every attributable point can be written about in a neutral fashion. An example of a quote that may be non-neutral though properly attributed and sourced is given at [[WP:FRINGE#Sourcing and attribution]]. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 00:01, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

:*Since describing a single POV can be achieved in an NPOV fashion, then the description in the third paragraph is incorrect which says that a single POV without response fails NPOV.
:*Judging/assessing a single POV is another matter altogether. But just because there may be no attributable assessments, does not make the description of a single POV automatically fail NPOV. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 00:34, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

I do not agree with the demand that not only must something be said in a respected peer reviewed journal, but that we must wait for other independent researchers to chime in, in OTHER respected peer reviewed journals, and agree with the first researcher that the claim is valid. The first post would constitute a reliable source satisfying [[WP:ATT]] and would be usable in a Wikipedia article. Similarly a book from a respected publisher would constitute a reliable source, without waiting for some other authority to write another book that says &quot;I agree with the first book.&quot; The demand places the bar way too high. It may be years before someone completely independent of the first researcher publishes the demanded blessing of the first researcher's claim. [[User:Edison|Edison]] 20:20, 9 April 2007 (UTC)

==[[Schmidt Sting Pain Index]]==
Can some of you knowledgable and discerning scientist Wikipedians take a look at this please? This article has currently been getting some coverage in popular &quot;gee whiz funny link of the day... how goofy!&quot; type blogs ( I hate it when this happens and the article in question is dubious... I think it gives a bad impression of wikipedia), but it seems to be mainly based on the idea that this one insect scientist guy wrote some goofy comments for an insect sting pain index one day. Ok, I agree that insect scientists are allowed to have senses of humour (WITHIN LIMITS, for the sake of us all), but I am concerned that 1) this scale is not really widespread and may be just one scale promoted by one guy without much acceptance in the insect expert community. 2) the pdf article linked which this wikipedia entry seems to be based on does not seem to say that Schmidt actually wrote those goofy comments. Its a bit ambiguous, but its seems to say that &quot;the media&quot; (without specifying what media) came up with the goofy comments to append to Schmidt's original dry scale(I think this may be another case where people exaggerate or misinterpret what an article is saying). I dont have any access to science journal databases, and am certainly no science or insect expert. But these concerns and quick scans of google books and google scholar led me to bring this issue to wiser heads. Thanks very much  for checking this out.

The index also has been mentioned in popular science pubs; though it doesn't appear to be taken seriously by scientists.  A scientifically-based pain index would be interesting (though I decline any offers to participate in such research); both this and the related Starr index appear to be little more than the opinions of the bug guys in question.  The article certainly dances on the edge of notability.  --[[User:EngineerScotty|EngineerScotty]] 05:30, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

******Ok, once again, in case anyone can actually respond on my point: the list of criteria here seems to be a misguided attempt to define reasons for notability that no one brings up in debates.  If the issue was the over-''deletion'' of science articles, having these criteria would make sense.  But it seems to me that the main thrust of this proposal is in the opposite direction.  These are just fodder for disagreement (see [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sorce theory]] for instance) and distract from the main point about the POV and OR issues involved in using only sources from a single author.

********Good: a direct response.  Two brief points: (1) Arbcom never asked for criteria, but they did encourage developing a guideline, which is different.  (2) The EU deletion debate looks very different to me - there, the argument was done from first principles and it worked very nicely, and it skirted around the edge of these criteria (no one ever talked about whether the EU concept was &quot;textbook science&quot; or had institutional support)... and as for extended discussions with Iantresman... I don't think the criteria will make one bit of difference, and that's not a very good reason anyway.  Long-winded debate... I don't think we should seek to avoid it as a general principle, debate is a good thing.  Criteria would simplify the job but scientific topics aren't exactly overwhelming the AfD lists.

== General notability guideline template ==
Since the general notability guideline is central to most sub-pages, someone came up with the idea of creating a centralized template which will be consistent among the permutations from WP:N.  Please see whether we can make this work here.  The text is meant to be fairly generic, but it may make sense to add text following the template for fine tuning, or help us to make the template more applicable if it is not reflecting the consensus for notability.  I certainly didn't get everything that I wanted, but I'm very happy to see the compromises that make this a fairly representive of the attitude of the project.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 01:12, 7 April 2007 (UTC)

==Merging [[Wikipedia:Notability (numbers)]]==
What are the thoughts on merging [[Wikipedia:Notability (numbers)]] into this guideline proposal?  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 19:15, 25 April 2007 (UTC)

I've added a brief section which is the meat from the numbers guideline.  This seems appropriately and neatly combined here.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 16:29, 15 May 2007 (UTC)
*It's a bad idea, as explained on the talk page of WP:NUM.

== Scope creep ==

I may be beating a dead horse here, but all the references to NPOV, proponents and advocacy make it seem like this is about pseudoscience/fringe science, and the discussion above seems to confirm it. As it tries to apply to specialised but uncontroversial science, not much of it bears any resemblance to reality. --[[User:Abu-Fool Danyal ibn Amir al-Makhiri|Abu-Fool Danyal ibn Amir al-Makhiri]] 02:29, 6 June 2007 (UTC)

== Proposal concerns (LV) ==
Note that I came here from a couple of AfDs which were trying to present this as policy criteria for an article's deleltion.  As I read down the line, I encountered several problems with the proposed guideline.  I apologize if any and all of the below have been covered in the Talk Archives, which I am not going to read now.

Problems that I have at present with the proposal:

*Introduction:
:* &quot;A topic that is acceptable under this guideline is an appropriate part of Wikipedia.&quot;
::Pretty sweeping blanket statement, to me.  No other Notability criteria I'm aware of suggests that &quot;if it passes this, it's in.&quot;  Indeed, it seems to violate the principle of a Guideline to me, which always limits itself to allow potential exceptions.  Further, each section usually defines which criteria are primary and which are secondary.
*Notability of topics related to science:
:*&quot;Decisions about including or excluding material must always reflect the opinions of outside authorities, not those of Wikipedia editors.&quot;
::I know this has been mentioned above, but I want to echo this concern:  Decisions about including or excluding material must always reflect the consensus of the Wikipedia editors.  Anything else beyond that is helpful clarification, or it becomes fodder for people to [[WP:IAR]].
::I'd feel much more comfortable with something like, ''&quot;Deicions about including or excluding material on a scientific basis ought to be supported by the opinions and stated facts of outside authorities, as per [[WP:RS|Wikpedia:Reliable Sources]].&quot;''  Start throwing 'musts' around in anything but policy (perhaps only unbreakable/unmodifiable policy) and you'll get a lot of irate editors, scientific or not.
:*&quot;Although publication creates verifiability and reputable journals are reliable sources, publication by itself is not a sufficient (and sometimes not necessary) standard for encyclopedic notability. Unpublished research fails no original research and often lacks verifiability, so it is unacceptable by policy. Research published in a reputable publication passes these thresholds but reflects the point of view of one researcher or research term and, unless it generates a significant outside response by the scientific community or the population at large, focusing on such research in a Wikipedia article does not adequately conform to Wikipedia's policy on neutrality, in particular the section on undue weight. This guideline clarifies how the Wikipedia community has applied NPOV to articles on scientific topics. It does however not apply to the inclusion of scientific research as authorative sources within articles. The criterion for such sources is not that they are notable, but that they are reliable.&quot;
::Wha?  Could this be any more complex?  I actually had to diagram this paragraph out to understand it.  My hypothesis is most editors will not.  Can't you simply say it is normally necessary to follow the general notability guidelines with respect to neutral, multiple, independent, verifiabile, reliable sources?  And if you do that, what is the point of this whole section - I'm seriously not understanding how this adds anything to present guidelines.
* Criteria / General
:*&quot;1. Widely cited. Papers covering the topic have been widely1 commented on in academic writing within the topic's field.
::2. Outside notability. The topic is notable due to significant coverage in reliable sources outside of academic publications.&quot;  
::So we want articles only commented upon widely by multiple academic sources, which also are commented on outside academic sources?  Seems pretty wide, to me.
::Aside from that, I know I read somewhere that Wikipedia is not just a general encyclopedia, but can cover articles appropriate to special subject encyclopedias as well.  Thus 2. might well fail, as most specialist encyclopedias I am aware of have many articles which would only be known inside the discipline the encyclopedia represents.
:*&quot;Notable topics which are primarily non-scientific... [etc.]&quot;
::Boy, I'm going to love the AfDs which try to define whether a topic is &quot;science&quot; or not trying to use this.  Not to mention the arguments you'll get whether or not cosmology (for example) has a scientific basis or not.  Not to mention you're setting up a criteria which is so subjective it will rarely-if-ever be able to objectively define where this guideline would be relevant or not.
::Also, you will get editors asking whether the guideline itself applies or not - something I don't think I've ever seen with any of the other specialty N's about the guideline ''itself''.  I don't need to know if Burpa-Cola has been covered in the Cola News and CNN, or if Billy Bob Arthbutnott has both parlimentary opinions as well as the Sun documenting his career to know that Corp or People:Politicians applies.
*Scientific terms
:Again, how does this get beyond neologisms in a way that Avoid Neologisms doesn't, aside from adding the words &quot;scientific literature&quot;?
*Numbers and Sources
:*&quot;1. Have professional mathematicians published papers on this topic?
::2. Is the sequence listed in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences? (In the case of sequences of rational numbers, does the OEIS have the sequences of numerators and denominators of the relevant fractions?)
::3. Do MathWorld and PlanetMath have articles on this topic?&quot;
:::This may be taken from WProj numbers, I don't know.  But are you stipulating that 2 and 3 are reliable sources? (The Sources section has exactly this same problem.  You're controlling what is considered a Reliable Source without allowing the Wikipedia community at large to define that.  I have a problem with that - if I were arguing Notability(Religion), I would not want it to say that the Bible is an authorized source and any other 'holy' texts by default would have to prove themselves.)
*Sources
:*&quot;Scientific discovery is often disconnected from public discourse, so standard methods of sourcing and verifying are not always applicable. A scientific topic which yields low hit counts in the Google test...&quot;
::That's nice.  The Google test is widely regarded as discredited anyway.  Yes, I know it's still used, but it's questionability is known.
::Also, verifying and sourcing is verfying and sourcing.  I believe what's being aimed at here is scientific notability may have a smaller and different base (with different types of sourcing) for inclusion than other forms of notability.  So why not say that?  Except that above you're demanding 'popular' coverage as well as academic.
:*&quot;Web (and library) searches should therefore be evaluated based on the quality rather than the quantity of the finds.&quot;
::Thus, you allow extreme subjectivity creep, unless you are going to make further instruction creep in what constitutes scientific quality.  (My Jung is better than your Freud.  My Hawking beats your Einstein.  My t test is better than your bean counting.)  Common sense might be able to dictate that, but science is full of periods of flying in the face of qualitative common sense and succeeding - because it's right.
:*&quot;The following is a list of sources with qualifications of their usefulness.&quot;
::Again, you're preaching what is and isn't acceptable as a source, without allowing the community consensus to decide this over time. 
:*&quot;Google, Yahoo.... [etc]&quot; 
::Uh, again, how is this any different from Google test?

Finally, may I invite you to consider that most notability guidelines are much less complex and much more tolerant of letting individual cases be decided as individual cases?  And I hope that the question about &quot;Have we reached consensus?&quot; is asking if you as the editors have reached consensus about what you want to present to the community as a whole, as opposed to &quot;Are we ready to make this policy ourselves?&quot;

It may seem like I'm pissing all over your proposal.  I hope it doesn't, because I'd like to see a Notability(Science) guideline.  But I want it to be one that's usable and used - I wouldn't do either with this, and I'd argue as need be when someone tries to use this as a vote justification (which will happen, whether you want it to or not.)  Sorry for the length of the diatribe.

The rejected tag is appropriate and should stand until there is adequate discussion here to demonstrate active interest in the proposal.

It looks like a number of the contributors here are no longer active at WP: Lantreman ws banned, BDJ and Science Appologist have quit, Minder Binder, Abu-Fool Danyal ibn Amir al-Makhiri, and Laughing Vulcan have not contributed substantially since June and at all since mid-July.   &lt;s&gt;Trials and Errors and Radiant are advocating reinstating this as a proposal&lt;/s&gt;, but I don't think that there are enough editors who see this as a need.

* What I see now is something that is so watered down and nebulous that it cannot act as a genuine policy.  If people want to revive this effort, then we need to return to a version like [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Notability_%28science%29&amp;oldid=117329647 this one] and work from there.  IMO, what happenned to this effort is that a number of people whose pet articles were running afoul of this proposed policy chose to get involved with the blatant intent to sabotage it and remove its impact on their work, and unfortunately succeeded in doing so.&lt;br&gt;IMO, there is a genuine need for a policy like this to clarify what &quot;notability&quot; and &quot;verifiability&quot; mean in the context of a science article, and how [[WP:UNDUE]] should be applied.  It may be that this is an issue that is best handled by the admins with the advice and consent of the community so that we can avoid the pitfalls of the past. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:49, 20 August 2007 (UTC)
*I see, if not frequent, so at least [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere/Wikipedia:Notability_%28science%29&amp;limit=500&amp;from=0 recurrent use] of this guideline/proposed guideline/essay, very much in keeping with the rather low number of science-related AfD discussions. Absence of discussion on the talk page certainly doesn't establish rejection. I agree with EMS that the two-item version is watered down beyond recognition of the original version, and I don't see any consensus for it. ~ [[User:Trialsanderrors|trialsanderrors]] 16:07, 20 August 2007 (UTC)
:: Per [[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines]]: ''&quot;A rejected page is any proposal for which consensus support is not present, regardless of whether there is active discussion or not. Consensus need not be fully opposed; if consensus is neutral on the issue and unlikely to improve, the proposal is likewise rejected. It is considered bad form to hide this fact, e.g. by removing the tag. Making small changes will not change this fact, nor will repetitive arguments. Generally it is wiser to rewrite a rejected proposal from scratch and start in a different direction.&quot;'' --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 16:14, 20 August 2007 (UTC)

::: It seems to me that a lot of work has gone into turning this into something that everyone can reject.

== Reverted to earlier version ==

I have reverted the article to the form of lat March, with some twaking of the lead and the first section.  The revised first section now has a simple first paragraph that states the need to this policy as succinctly as I can.  The next two paragraphs have had their order exchanged so that the farily dry &quot;relevance&quot; paragraph comes last.  The previous last paragraph has been removed as an unreadable mess.  (I believe I drafted that paragraph originally, but it really never worked as intended, and only got worse over time.)

The {{tl|rejected}} tag has been kept as a matter of form, with the {{tl|proposed}} tag just commented out but still present.  I for one would be happy to see this version go back to &quot;proposed&quot; status, but I want to see if others are on-board for doing that.  Let's just say that after having taken a rest, I am ready and willing to work towards acceptance of a functional version of this as a policy or guideline if others are. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 18:24, 20 August 2007 (UTC)

:Personally, I don't see a lot of point reviving this.  The criteria have always been an attempt to change practice rather than an attempt to document practice, and to most people, the criteria and the proposal are one and the same.  The criteria really haven't caught on, and from my experience, people rely on other policies for scientific topics, like [[WP:OR]] and [[WP:V]], and where notability is needed, the general [[WP:N]] seems to be sufficient and its use is accepted.

:: Having looked more closely at the edit history, I find that your attempt to streamline this two two items has met fairly stiff resistance.  Then again, that is little wonder since your proposed consolidation ends up being little more than a restatement of pre-existing policy.  The goal of this proposal is to set up guidelines that go beyond the current policies and which are adapted to the issues which are unique to science.  Wikiepdia has very much outgrown [[WP:NOR|&quot;No original research&quot;]] and the requirement to use [[peer review]]ed [[scientific journal|journals]].  What do you do with a source that is &quot;peer reviewed&quot; but where the peers are fellow followers of a [[fringe science|fringe theory]]?  What do you do about the use of [[Nature (journal)|Nature magazine]], which is highly respected but does not use peer review to help select its articles?  What do you make of a theory published in a respected scientific journals but on which noone has cared to comment except the author?  What do you do with the [[cold fusion]] controversy created by Pons and Fleishman back in 1987 which obviously is notable within science but which was never respected by it?  There will not be many of these to contend with, but when they do appear this guideline will be invaluable.
:::::Please excuse my comment here, but the article content of Nature is peer reviewed. Like some other journals, it has on rare occasions published things based on consensus of the key editors, without formal peer review. The news content is not, of course, just editorially prepared -- by the most careful people around. It was they who caught the similarity of the stem cell photos after the peer reviewers missed it.

:: You like to cite [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sorce theory]] as a place where this guideline did not work.  For that I solidly disagree.  That article's creator had to play all kinds of games with these criteria to make a case for keeping the article.  In the end, his attempts to make the article look acceptable only helped to do it in.  In context this is a farly powerful tool.  In addition, it is not going to do in fringe science articles.  For example, I helped by have an aritcle on a book by [[Halton Arp]] kept because it was noted within the field of astronomy and also gained some measure of attention from the public at large.  That press coverage (both scientific and popular) could establish notability as described here was helpful in that discussion. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 01:03, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

:::You might note that my reduction to two criteria stood for over two months without comment.  You may also note that coverage by press and by scientific sources were the criteria I left in place, since those are the only part of the criteria that are useful.  What I object to are the other criteria, like &quot;textbook science&quot; or &quot;popular belief&quot; that are redundant and provide loopholes for argumentative POV pushers.  Can you hypothesize an example where a topic is &quot;textbook science&quot; or has a &quot;prominent advocate&quot; or has &quot;institutional support&quot; where the topic would be acceptable for Wikipedia ''without'' significant coverage in independent, reliable sources, academic or otherwise?

::::I am not sure whether I agree with you or not. I certainly think that there are science articles that are best referenced by standard textbooks, particularly for articles that are at the level of high school or early university science. For example, we probably do not want to source a peer reviewed journal on [[density]] and we do not. Are textbooks reliable sources? If so we do not need to mention &quot;textbook science&quot;, but if they are not, we probable do. --[[User:Bduke|Bduke]] 03:09, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

::::::: As for the other criteria: you agree on 3 and 4.  6 is totally pointless, because none of the criteria would expire once met.  7 obviously must require sourcing to back it up or it's totally vacuous and anyone could claim it about anything.  And anything discussed in a legitimate textbook is already covered in a reliable source, and I highly doubt that we'd ever find a case where one textbook mentions a topic but absolutely no other sources do.  Yeah, I agree, if we pare it any further, the ''criteria'' say nothing more than [[WP:N]] does.. so maybe we should lose the criteria altogether, or just spend more time explaining the issues that arise in assessing the quality of sources, especially academic ones.

(unindent) I think that you have just made an excellent suggestions in calling for an explanation of how to assess the reliability and relevance of sources.  Given some of the issues I have had recently with the anti-relativists over at [[talk:Herbert Dingle]], this makes a lot of sense.  (In those discussions, at least one person would take anything that he could find from a &quot;peer reviewed journal&quot; as evidence of a conflict over relativity and the [[twin paradox]].  Said contributions come from almost unknown overseas journals and in another case a blatantly anti-relativity publisher.)  I would still keep the remaining criteria as a way of saying that those things are the primary hallmarks of scientific notability, while noting that other options for notability are not prohibited. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:20, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

:I believe that's better, but I still think we should remove the criteria.  The problem is, people always seem to conflate a notability guideline and its criteria, while all other text is ignored.  By not having criteria, we would force people to read the discussion about the reliability of scientific sources.  (Actually, come to think about it, &quot;Notability (science)&quot; may not be the best name.  What about &quot;Reliable sources (scientific)&quot;?)

:: The criteria don't exist for the benefit of those that would abuse them but instead for the benefit of those that are looking for good guidance on what is acceptable.  The creator of an article will invariably try to defend it against an AfD.  IMO, if the article's creator can make a case that their article is acceptable under this criteria and everyone agrees, then these criteria have done a service in helping people to make that decision.  Similarly, if people listen to the creator's case and conclude that it does not hold water, then the criteria will also have helped by focussing the debate on the relevant issues and helping to bring about the deletion.  So as I see it these criteria overall are helpful.  Besides, it really is in the absense of clear guidelines that you get the nastiest debates. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 19:01, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

(a) Notability, (b) reliability of a source, and (b) reliable of the facts in that source, are all quite different, and tell us how to describe information, not whether to include it. If Arp publishes some information in an obscure overseas publications, and Stephen Hawkins in in Nature, Arp's supporters will find his article more notable, and no less reliable. And if Hawkins is described in a textbook, then it tells us that his ideas have a wider readership, and neither are as popular as today's astrology column.  &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment was added by [[Special:Contributions/{{{IP|{{{User|84.244.165.174}}}}}}|{{{IP|{{{User|84.244.165.174}}}}}}]] ([[User talk:{{{IP|{{{User|84.244.165.174}}}}}}|talk]]) {{{Time|17:34, August 21, 2007 (UTC)}}}&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Abandon this as an unnecessary complication==

Whether a peer review journal, a textbook, a popular book, a university hosted website or a notable persons personal site  is sufficiently reliable, reputable, or secondary is probably best treated on a case by case basis, and in any case this is not a problem specific to science.

Are there any controversial articles that are better treated by Notability (science) than by WP:NOR, WPV, and WP:N?  I think not.  I think there are too many guidelines, especially where they overlap.  True science should only need to satisfy WP:NOR and WP:V.  Where the subject is not true science, or is borderline, a further test should be simply whether others have written about it.  WP:N provides this test.  A lot of work has been invested in this project page, but that is not sufficient reason to adopt it.  It is rule creep, and it does damage by obfuscating more important policies and guidelines.

There seems to be tendency here for some to want a guideline to provide a science-quality test.  This is not an encyclopaedia’s role.  The ascribing of “Finge science”, “pseudo science” or “lunacy” to any theory is a job for third party sources, not for wikipedia rules.  

EMS suggests that some nasty debates exist because of the weakness of this guideline.  Some elaboration would be nice.  Discussion above suggests to me that the relativity article needs work, not that wikipedia needs more rules.

This project page should be abandoned.  Science is well covered by WP:OR and WP:V, and where notability is needed, the general WP:N seems to be sufficient and its use is accepted. --[[User:SmokeyJoe|SmokeyJoe]] 02:08, 22 August 2007 (UTC)

It’s always about sourcing, specifically whether the sources are sufficiently independent, sufficiently secondary, sufficiently reputable (not a blog or similar), or covers the subject in sufficient depth.  These are all straight WP:N issues, deriving directly from a combination of WP:NOR and WP:V.  There is plenty of evidence of spirited debate in places about the science of the content involved, and this sometimes is uncivil, but such spirited debate seems to me to be irrelevant to the debates, and always a symptom of editors who are too far into OR editing and are not looking at the subject objectively.  This is why Notability (science) may do more harm than good.  It suggests that there is something special about science.  The criteria for inclusion in wikipedia do not depend upon the science.

==physics? i think not==
do not confuse the observer effect with the uncertainty principle. the uncertainty principle has nothing to do with &quot;observing&quot;, it has to do with measuring. the observer effect is a supposed effect of observing an event and the influence of your presence on the event. no one would ever have to actually observe a particle's position to obfuscate its momentum, the mere act of using the photons to measure its position, even if nobody ever observed it, would suffice.

-------------
don't you have to observe in order to measure?
-------------

Indeed.  But what does measuring have to do with Quantum Mechanics exactly?  

To measure is to observe the results of a measurement process [that ascertains the subject measurement].  Humans observe with their senses — the senses that humans have.  Other conscious beings, perhaps including computers, may have other senses with which they can implement tools for making measurements.  At the end of the day, measuring ''ALWAYS'' involves observing.  

Tools used by beings to make measurements are limited (in their accuracy) by various factors including the limitations of ones senses.  The often-mentioned example of bouncing a photon off of an atom to measure its position illustrates the problem with knowing the position ''AND'' momentum of ''THAT'' atom at the ''SAME MOMENT'' in time.  The concept usually centers on the fact that the position measurement photon will change the momentum of the subject atom.  But aren't there other aspects of this problem?  

In the limit (considering the non-zero mass of the atom and the non-zero energy of the photon), can one ever know perfectly even the position alone?  Perhaps so, since the mechanical inertance of the atom precludes its reaction at ''THAT'' infinitesimal instant in time.  

Why is not ''THIS'' example an instance of &quot;observer effect&quot; rather than the uncertainty principle, per se?  If one seeks only to measure the position alone, then maybe it is neither.  Then again, is it not &quot;Observer Effect&quot; even if the momentum is changed by measuring only the position?  One would think so.  

Well, what if we start with measuring the momentum &quot;first&quot;?  How does one measure momentum, anyway?  Again, we observers devise a measurement process that allows our senses to detect the &quot;answer.&quot;  Momentum is mass times velocity.  If we know the mass, we might then seek to measure the velocity.  Human observers tend to ascertain velocity by measuring position at two points in time.  For non-zero velocities, this means two different points in space, of course.  Yet, [instantaneous] velocity is ''DEFINED'' at only one point in space and time.  Thus, one cannot measure velocity (or momentum) in this manner: one must ''WAIT'' to ''SEE'' how fast it is moving, and this yields only an average (not instantaneous) value.  

Before continuing on to propose measuring momentum, per se, by some other means (say, smashing the atom into an obstacle at a known position), we should note that the Uncertainty Principle pertains only to Quantum Mechanics.  In ''THAT'' world, particles are not particles; rather, they are probability density functions.  The interpretation of this ''MODEL'' of a particle says the position and momentum of the subject particle are INHERENTLY uncertain by virtue of the mathematical model itself.  To precisely derive the position, one must manipulate the model in a manner that causes the momentum &quot;to drop out of the formula,&quot; and vice versa.  

The relationship between position and momentum described by Quantum Mechanics is somewhat like the relationship between the time domain and the frequency domain described by the Fourier Transform.  One can say that there is some similarity as well between position and velocity in Classical Mechanics.  In fact, the description above with knowing the velocity versus position of the atom is exactly that: Classical Mechanics. 

Following this line of thinking, one (''such as this user who is not fluent in the intricate semantics of Quantum Theory'') might be likely to reach these conclusions: 
 

'''1. Using &quot;particulate&quot; atoms and photons to describe the Uncertainty Principle of Quantum Mechanics is ''flat wrong''.''' 

'''2. One does not observe Quantum Mechanics.  Rather, one uses that theory to make calculations to explain the observations of certain experiments.'''

'''3. Measurements ''ALWAYS'' involve observations and therefore also ''ALWAYS'' involve the Observer Effect.  Perhaps this ''IS'' the “Theory of the Observer Effect.”'''

'''4. The Uncertainty Principle of Quantum Mechanics and the Observer Effect are ''fundamentally'' unrelated.'''  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:JimRodgers|JimRodgers]] ([[User talk:JimRodgers|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/JimRodgers|contribs]]) 12:54, 31 July 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

For some reason this article is more focused on what the observer effect is not. --[[User:Nathanael Bar-Aur L.|Nathanael Bar-Aur L.]] 20:09, 10 April 2007 (UTC)

From what I understood from other sources, the observer effect is basically the collapsing of a quantum system's wavefunction that happens the moment a measurement in made upon it (by an &quot;observer&quot;), therefore cancelling any superposition that may have existed beforehand, and giving specific definition to the renderings. Is this correct? --[[User:Nathanael Bar-Aur L.|Nathanael Bar-Aur L.]] 20:21, 10 April 2007 (UTC)

==Suggestions==
Current article states &quot;not that of the driveshaft, along the axis of the car&quot;.
Add a paragraph that illustrates this with the driveshaft of the front-engine, rear-wheel-drive Porsche 928.
Also industrial examples and diagrams from mechanical engineering and classical mechanics.
e.g. a torque tube to allign parts of a hinge operated by two hydraulic cylinders.&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/206.188.57.60|206.188.57.60]] ([[User talk:206.188.57.60|talk]]) 14:42, 30 October 2006 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;

== Diagrams ==
Can anyone find a picture of this? I'm having a very hard time picturing what this would look like...[[User:70.157.134.125|70.157.134.125]] 01:01, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

==Accuracy==
This page is not really accurate. Cars like the STS, Corvette, etc. have independent rear suspensions, and the torque tube is not used to transmit acceleration forces in these vehicles. Rather, it is because they have trans-axles in the rear of the car and it connects the trans-axle with the engine in the front. However, I am not enough of an expert on the subject to write a clear and well-written clarification so I have just added some templates to the top of the page. --[[User:Ozziegt|Ozziegt]] ([[User talk:Ozziegt|talk]]) 21:33, 1 July 2009 (UTC)

:Corvette since at least 1988 doesn't have a torque tube (unless they put one in later), and apart from the Miata I'm hard pushed to think of an IRS that uses one. I agree, this article is pretty horrid, it needs a rewrite rather than refs. [[User:Greglocock|Greglocock]] ([[User talk:Greglocock|talk]]) 11:13, 2 July 2009 (UTC)

:Corvettes since the late 90's do indeed have torque tubes, of the same type that the Porsche 924/944/928 etc use.  All the mentioned Porsches are IRS and use a torque tube.  Part of the probem with this article is that it lumps very diverse systems together;  the early Ford systems are completely different from the Corvette/Porsche systems.  Both are classified as torque tubes, but the article does not focus on the essence of a TT, which is the use of a smaller torque-transmitting element inside a carrier. The carrier may or may not be static and may or may not be carrying driveline forces (like the Fords). [[User:52FordF-1|52FordF-1]] ([[User talk:52FordF-1|talk]]) 15:44, 18 July 2009 (UTC)

::Yup my bad, 2005 Corvette (as a random example) uses a transaxle and a torque tube. Note that the Corvette system is different to the Peugoet one, as the latter includes an articulating joint at the front whereas the Corvette system does not. This is a big deal, to a driveline engineer at least.[[User:Greglocock|Greglocock]] ([[User talk:Greglocock|talk]]) 23:25, 18 July 2009 (UTC)

:Agreed. The article as written is essentially BS. A torque tube fundamentally counteracts the torque of the driveshaft; the alternative is that the torque is counteracted by the torsional rigidity of the frame (the net torque must, obviously, be zero otherwise the rear of the car would rotate). The torque tube often does transfer forward wheel force to the front of the car, but this is not inherent in the mere fact of having a torque tube: there must still be a mechanism locating the wheels longitudinally relative to the diff/transaxle. This is analogous to the usual need to locate the wheels relative to the frame (most simply, with leaf springs) in order to move the car forward.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/110.175.57.184|110.175.57.184]] ([[User talk:110.175.57.184|talk]]) 05:05, 18 March 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== simple definition? ==

It has been my understanding from looking through service manuals and talking to mechanics that the corvette style torque tubes are just an enclosed driveshaft that connects a front mounted engine to the rear mounted transmission (with fully independent rear suspension)

I guess it's not simply called a 'driveshaft' in a classical sense since it doesn't connect a front mounted transmission to the rear differential  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/184.57.87.173|184.57.87.173]] ([[User talk:184.57.87.173|talk]]) 20:38, 15 August 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</text>

'''''Hello!'''''

Thanks for uploading some pictures to Wikipedia.  I wanted to make sure you were aware of some of the requirements and good practices for uploaded images.

*'''Pick an image name.'''
:When [[Special:Upload|uploading]] an image, pick a file name that is descriptive, and unique.  Remember that many images may be uploaded about the same topic, and remember that names are case sensitive.

*'''Source the image.'''
:On the [[Help:Image page|image description page]], explain where the image came from.  If you created the image yourself, then say so.  If it's from the web, give a URL.  If it's a screenshot of a movie or game, or a scan from a book, give the title.

*'''Provide copyright and license information.'''
:This part is a little bit trickier, but it's very important.  The copyright of the image generally belongs to whomever created it.
::''If it's a photograph you took, or an image you created'' (modifying an image that already exists doesn't count) in software like [[Photoshop]] or [[GIMP]], then you own the copyright.  To upload it to Wikipedia, you must agree to license it under the [[GFDL]] (which allows anyone to use it, but requires that they give credit to the original author and requires that any further edit to the image be licensed under the GFDL as well) or release it into the [[public domain]] (which allows anyone to use it for any purpose without restriction.)  Do this by placing an appropriate [[WP:ICT|tag]] on the [[Wikipedia:image description page|image description page]], like &amp;#123;{[[Template:GFDL|GFDL]]}} or &amp;#123;{[[Template:PD|PD]]}}.  Be sure to mention that you created the image.  If you're using &amp;#123;{[[Template:PD|PD]]}}, you may also want to use &amp;#123;{[[Template:NoRightsReserved|NoRightsReserved]]}}, since there is some dispute as to whether one may grant items into the public domain.
::''If you didn't create the image,'' or the copyright somehow belongs to another party (like a screenshot, which you might &quot;create&quot;, but the copyright belongs to the author of the movie or video game), then you need to find another [[WP:ICT|tag]] that describes the copyright status of the image.  Images used on Wikipedia need to be free for our use and the use of [[WP:FORKS|sites]] which reproduce our content.  This means that images cannot have a restriction such as &quot;only for use by Wikipedia&quot;, or &quot;for non-commercial use only&quot;, or &quot;for educational use&quot;.  Images without a free license may be usable in certain articles under [[WP:FU|fair use]], but such a use should be justified on the image description page.

*'''Describe the image.'''
:To another reader, the image may not be immediately understood.  A caption in an article doesn't explain the image to a visitor who sees it on its image page.  Put a brief explanation of what is in the image on the image description page, similar to what you might include in a caption on an article.  

Some links to Wikipedia pages on this subject: 

'''[[Wikipedia:Copyrights#Image guidelines|Copyrights]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags|Copyright tags]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Fair use|Fair use]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Image description page|Image description page]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Granting work into the public domain|Public domain]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion|Images for deletion]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Possibly unfree images|Possibly unfree images]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Copyright problems|Copyright problems]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Uploading images|Uploading images]]'''

Thanks again for your contributions.  If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me at my talk page. [[User:Feydey|feydey]] 19:42, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

An '''anti-submarine missile'''  is a [[standoff missile|standoff]] [[anti-submarine weapon]]. Often a variant of [[anti-ship missile]] designs an anti-submarine systems typically use a [[jet engine|jet]] or [[rocket engine|rocket]] engine, to deliver: an [[explosive material|explosive]] [[warhead]] aimed directly at a [[submarine]]; a [[depth charge]], or;  a homing [[torpedo]] that is carried from a launch ship, or other  platform, to the vicinity of a target.
[[File:Ikara missile.JPG|thumb|right|&lt;small&gt;[[Ikara (missile)|Ikara]], an [[Australia]]n-designed missile used by several navies between the 1960s and 1990s; a [[rocket engine|rocket]]-parachute delivery system carried an [[acoustic torpedo]] up to 10 nautical miles (19 km) after launch. A variant re-designed in the UK and used by the Royal Navy could deliver a [[Nuclear depth bomb|nuclear depth charge]].&lt;/small&gt;]]
[[File:Maille-Braize-14.jpg|thumb|&lt;small&gt;The [[Malafon]], used by the French Navy between 1966 and 1997, used a rocket-assisted glider to carry a torpedo up to 8 nautical miles (13 km) after launch&lt;/small&gt;. ]]

==History==
[[Depth charge]]s were the earliest weapons designed for use by ships against submerged [[submarine]]s. These explosives were initially dropped as the ship moved over the presumed location of a submarine. Before World War II, shipboard [[sonar]] was unable to maintain contact with a submarine at close range. 

Various [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]]-type projectors, including [[hedgehog (weapon)|hedgehog]] and [[squid (weapon)|squid]], were devised during [[World War II]] to allow a ship to maintain sonar contact while lobbing explosive charges toward the submarine.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Terry, and Costello, John ''The Battle of the Atlantic'' (1977) Dial Press {{Listed Invalid ISBN|0-8037-6454-2}} pp.307-308&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the [[Cold War]], [[missile]]s were developed to provide greater range with reduced [[recoil]]. Some missiles and rockets carry [[homing torpedo]]es to provide terminal guidance for the warhead.&lt;ref&gt;Albrecht, Gerhard ''Weyer's Warships of the World'' (1969) United States Naval Institute p.385&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''northern river shark''' or '''New Guinea river shark''' (''Glyphis garricki'') is a [[species]] of [[requiem shark]], in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Requiem shark|Carcharhinidae]] found in scattered [[tidal river]]s and associated coastal waters in northern [[Australia]] and in [[Papua New Guinea]]. This species inhabits areas with poor visibility, soft bottoms, and large [[tide]]s, with immature sharks ranging into [[freshwater|fresh]] and [[brackish water]]. It is similar to other river sharks in having a stocky grey body with a high back, tiny eyes, and broad fins. It measures up to {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} long.

Northern river sharks are likely [[piscivorous]]. This species is [[viviparous]], with females bearing litters of 9 young possibly every other year before the [[wet season]]. Very rare and facing threats from [[commercial fishing|commercial]] and [[recreational fishing]], and perhaps also [[habitat degradation]], this species has been assessed as [[Critically Endangered]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]].

==Taxonomy==
The first known specimens of the northern river shark, two newborn males from Papua New Guinea, were discovered by [[New Zealand]] [[ichthyologist]] [[Jack Garrick]], after whom the species was eventually  named. This shark was referred to as &quot;''Glyphis'' sp. C&quot; until 2008, when it was formally described by [[Leonard Compagno]], William White, and [[Peter R. Last]] in a [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] paper. The [[type specimen]] is a female {{convert|67|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, collected from the [[East Alligator River]], [[Kakadu National Park]], [[Northern Territory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Compagno, L.J.V. |author2=W.T.

==Distribution and habitat==
The northern river shark has been reported from [[King Sound]], the [[Ord River]], and Doctors Creek near [[Derby, Western Australia]], the [[Adelaide River|Adelaide]] and [[Alligator Rivers]] in Australia's [[Northern Territory]], and the [[Daru]] region and possibly the [[Fly River]] in Papua New Guinea. It inhabits large [[river]]s, [[estuaries]], and coastal [[bay]]s, all of which are characterized by high [[turbidity]], silty or muddy bottoms, and large tides. Young and juvenile sharks are found in fresh, brackish, and salt water ([[salinity]] ranging from 2 to 36 ppt), whereas adults have only been found in marine environments.&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pillans et al&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pillans, R.D. |author2=J.D.

==Description==
Like other members of its genus, the northern river shark has a stocky body with a high back. The head is wide and flattened, with a broadly rounded snout and minute eyes equipped with [[nictitating membrane]]s. Each [[nostril]] is divided into a very large incurrent opening and a small excurrent opening by a triangular skin flap. The sizable mouth is broadly arched, with short furrows at the corners. Thirty-one to 34 tooth rows are in the upper jaw and 30&amp;ndash;35 tooth rows are in the lower jaw; the upper teeth are upright and triangular with serrated edges, while the lower teeth are narrower and straight to slightly curved. In the largest individuals, the first few lower teeth from the jaw median are spear-shaped with serrations near the tip.&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;/&gt;

The [[pectoral fin]]s are large and broad, with gently backward-curving margins and pointed tips. The [[pelvic fin]]s are triangular with nearly straight trailing margins. The first [[dorsal fin]] is long-based and triangular, with the apex almost forming a right angle; the second dorsal fin is some two-thirds as high as the first. The origin of the first dorsal fin lies over the pectoral fin insertions, while that of second dorsal fin lies over the pelvic fin rear tips. No ridge exists between the dorsal fins. The [[anal fin]] is smaller than the second dorsal fin and has a strong notch in the rear margin. The [[caudal fin]] has a strong lower lobe and a long, narrow upper lobe with a ventral notch near the tip. The [[dermal denticle]]s are small, oval, and overlapping, bearing three horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth. This shark is steel-gray above and white below; the color transition is sharp, located well below the eye, and becomes jagged on the sides of the trunk. The anal and caudal fins become dusky or black towards the trailing margins and tips. The maximum known length is {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}}. This species differs from the [[speartooth shark]] (''G. glyphis'') in several [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] and [[meristic]] characters, including having fewer [[vertebra]]e (137&amp;ndash;151 versus 213&amp;ndash;222) and a lower, jagged gray-white color boundary.&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;/&gt;

==Biology and ecology==
With its slender teeth, small eyes, and high density of [[ampullae of Lorenzini]], the northern river shark seems to be [[adaptation|adapted]] for hunting [[fish]] in conditions of poor visibility. In Doctors Creek, sharks may move to and from favored feeding areas with the tide.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thorburn, D.C., D.L. Morgan, A.J. Rowland and H.S. Gill. (February 2004). [http://www.environment.gov.au/coasts/publications/pubs/glyphis-wa.pdf The northern river shark (''Glyphis'' sp. C) in Western Australia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108234623/http://environment.gov.au/coasts/publications/pubs/glyphis-wa.pdf |date=8 November 2011 }}. Report to the National Heritage Trust, Murdoch University. Retrieved on 10 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Like other requiem sharks, this species is [[viviparous]], with the developing [[embryo]]s forming a [[placenta]]l connection to their mother after exhausting their supply of [[yolk]]. Females give birth around October, before the start of the [[wet season]], on possibly a biennial cycle. One female examined contained nine [[fetus]]es.&lt;ref name=&quot;pillans et al&quot;/&gt; The young are born at under {{convert|67|cm|in|abbr=on}} long; males [[sexual maturity|mature]] between lengths of {{convert|1.2|and|1.4|m|ft|abbr=on}}, while females mature between lengths of {{convert|1.4|and|1.7|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;/&gt;

==Human interactions==
The northern river shark appears to be extremely rare, though more subpopulations may remain to be discovered in Australia and Papua New Guinea. Based on present information, no more than 250 mature individuals are estimated to exist in the wild, with no more than 50 in any particular subpopulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt; This species is caught legally and illegally by [[commercial fisheries]] using [[longline fishing|longlines]] and [[gillnet]]s, as well as by [[recreational fishing|recreational fishers]]; [[habitat degradation]] may pose a further threat to its survival. Because of its low natural abundance, limited distribution, stringent habitat requirements, and susceptibility to various human-caused threats, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] has assessed the northern river shark as [[critically endangered]]. It has also been listed as endangered on the 1999 Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, and on the 2000 Territory Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act. Kakadu National Park may be an important protected area for this species.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt; No regulations restrict the capture of this species in Papua New Guinea.&lt;ref name=&quot;white et al&quot;/&gt;

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Zoidberg. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Zoidberg~enwiki that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]]. If you think you might own all of the accounts with this name and this message is in error, please visit [[Special:MergeAccount]] to check and attach all of your accounts to prevent them from being renamed.

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== Hare Krishna picture ==

There is a picture of a Hare Krishna procession in the [[Religion_in_Mexico#Buddhism|Buddhism]] section, even with a caption about them being buddhists. Hare Krishnas are not buddhists, they are hindus. The article is semi-protected so I can not correct that myself. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Wenzelkarbovski|Wenzelkarbovski]] ([[User talk:Wenzelkarbovski|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Wenzelkarbovski|contribs]]) 17:39, 22 April 2015 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Self-ascription fallacy ==

''The last census reported, by self-ascription, that over 95% of the population is Christian.''

The so-called self-ascription of the census is nothing but a silly way of measuring data. Obviously they count children as Christians just because their parents say so. This people should either be clear about this or not count children at all. By the way, since a couple of years ago the Catholic Church has started to indoctrinate [[Huichol]] kids. Shame on us, Mexicans. Shame on us... The Huichols were one of the very few indigenous people whose religious tradition haven't been polluted by Catholicism but now the church has started taking advantage of the poverty of this people and the new constitutional reforms to infiltrate to their villages and improvise &quot;schools&quot;. Of course they know that adults wouldn't let themselves be indoctrinated so they choose to attack young minds. Catholicism and ignorance have been the ingredients of our condition as a Third World country.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Scandza|Scandza]] ([[User talk:Scandza|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Scandza|contribs]]) 13:27, 30 May 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;


Can anyone explain why the Evangelical Free Church of America does so many, many missionary trips to Mexico, when it's a predominantly catholic country? I mean, there are definite ideological differences involved, but I wasn't aware the two churches actively tried to convert each other's members.


==First phrase==

Any interest in removing &quot;Unlike some other Latin American countries&quot; from the first sentence of the article? It does not seem to serve any objective purpose and seems slightly antagonistic.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Namenderkrieg|Namenderkrieg]] ([[User talk:Namenderkrieg|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Namenderkrieg|contribs]]) 15:34, 24 March 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Easter==

I'm removing this:

&quot;Some of them however, do not celebrate Easter because they think that the Easter Bunny is the devil. Instead of celebrating Easter, they like to eat Mexican Pizzas.&quot;

because it's obviously untrue and just stupid. I think the article should be rewritten though, by someone more experienced than I am.--[[User:PARCGOP|PARCGOP]] 14:09, 7 April 2007 (UTC)

==Contradiction?==
This article says that 95% of people in Mexico are Roman Catholic.  The Mexico article states that 95% of people are Christian, and only 89% are Roman Catholic.  Which is correct, or am I just confused?
[[User:Yumecosmos|Yumecosmos]] ([[User talk:Yumecosmos|talk]]) 02:20, 9 January 2008 (UTC)

== Rewriting ==

I have imported the Religion section from the article on [[Mexico]] and integrated the information that was only on this article. I also moved around paragraphs and added a subtitle to make reading easier. Finally I removed the stub templates and replaced it with the expand one. --[[User:Marianika|Marianika]] ([[User talk:Marianika|talk]]) 16:32, 19 May 2008 (UTC)

== What about non-believers? ==

What about atheists, agnostics, deists in Mexico? How many Mexicans actually believe in God? Is there any data about that?  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/213.196.243.113|213.196.243.113]] ([[User talk:213.196.243.113|talk]]) 22:41, 27 May 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Mexican Ethnic Religion (Mexicayotl) ==

This article lacks a part about the growing movement of Mexicayotl, or Ethnic Mexican Culture or Religion, which is the revival of &quot;Aztec&quot; religion. --[[Special:Contributions/79.45.49.143|79.45.49.143]] ([[User talk:79.45.49.143|talk]]) 12:47, 16 August 2010 (UTC)

== Typo in Nonreligious section ==

'''John Ralph Ragazzini''' (January 3, 1912&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pnxBAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=John+Ralph+Ragazzini+1912&amp;dq=John+Ralph+Ragazzini+1912&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjC4sew9dPVAhXMHJoKHeWmAFsQ6AEIKzAB Profile of John Ralph Ragazzini]&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; November 22, 1988) was an [[United States|American]] [[electrical engineer]] and a professor of [[Electrical Engineering]]. 

==Biography==
Ragazzini was born in [[Manhattan, New York City]] and received the degrees of B.S. and E.E. at the [[City College of New York]] in 1932 and 1933 and earned the degrees of A.M. and Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at [[Columbia University]] in 1939 and 1941.

Ragazzini was dean of the School of Engineering and Science at [[New York University]] and during [[World War II]] he was chairman of the Department of Electrical Engineering at Columbia University, where he was involved in the [[Manhattan Project]].

Ragazzini's notable students are [[Rudolf E. Kálmán]] (see [[Kalman filter]]s), [[Eliahu Ibraham Jury]] (see [[Z-transform]]), [[Gene F. Franklin]] (see [[digital control]]), and [[Lotfi Asker Zadeh]] (see [[Fuzzy sets]] and [[Fuzzy logic]]).

Ragazzini is also credited, along with Lotfi Zadeh, in 1952, to have pioneered the development of the [[z-transform]] method in [[discrete-time]] [[signal processing]] and analysis.

In 1970 he received the [[Rufus Oldenburger Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asme.org/about-asme/honors-awards/achievement-awards/rufus-oldenburger-medal |title=Rufus Oldenburger Medal |publisher=[[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] |accessdate={{Format date|2013|2|14}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, [[American Automatic Control Council]] named [[John R. Ragazzini Award]] after Ragazzini and he was the first recipient of the award. Ragazzini died on 22 November 1988, aged 76.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/24/obituaries/john-ragazzini-76-educator-and-engineer.html&lt;/ref&gt;

I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under [[Wikipedia:Fair use|fair use]] but there is no [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline|explanation or rationale]] as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags/Fair use|boilerplate fair use template]], you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with [[WP:FU|fair use]].

Please go to [[:Image:Brokeninpieces.jpg|the image description page]] and edit it to include a [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline |fair use rationale]]. Using one of the templates at [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline]] is an easy way to insure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template. Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.

If there is other other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on the other images used on this page.

The '''United Church, Chapel on the Hill''' in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]] was the city's main church during [[World War II]]. Dedicated on September 30, 1943 and completed late in October 1943, it was originally a multi-denominational [[chapel]] shared by [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and [[Judaism|Jewish]] congregations.&lt;ref name=NationalRegister/&gt;&lt;ref name=churchhistory&gt;[http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=category&amp;sectionid=4&amp;id=39&amp;Itemid=55 Church History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728092956/http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=category&amp;sectionid=4&amp;id=39&amp;Itemid=55 |date=July 28, 2011 }}, United Church, Chapel on the Hill website, accessed March 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architectural design ==
The building design is a [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] 700-series [[U.S. Army]] chapel.&lt;ref name=Townsite&gt;[http://oakridgevisitor.com/history/pdf/OriginalTownSites.pdf Chapel on the Hill] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517124718/http://oakridgevisitor.com/history/pdf/OriginalTownSites.pdf |date=May 17, 2008 }} in ''Jackson Square – the original Townsite'', Oak Ridge Convention and Visitors' Bureau&lt;/ref&gt; It is a frame building built on a three-bay rectangular plan with a [[Steeple (architecture)|steeple]]d [[bell tower]] and a [[gable]] entry [[porch]]. It was one of three Army chapels built using the same design in Oak Ridge during World War II. One of the other two chapels, the West Chapel in the city's West Village area, was later torn down, but the East Chapel in the East Village is still in use.&lt;ref name=NationalRegister&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfo.doe.gov/me70/history/NPSweb/Oak_Ridge_Historic_District_(Preferred).pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form for Oak Ridge Historic District |date=July 18, 1991 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829041710/http://www.cfo.doe.gov/me70/history/NPSweb/Oak_Ridge_Historic_District_%28Preferred%29.pdf |archivedate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The U.S. Army built the chapel to house religious activities, as one of numerous community facilities in the &quot;townsite&quot; area of Oak Ridge. The building was dedicated on September 30, 1943, in a ceremony that included [[prayer]]s and talks by a Jewish [[rabbi]], a [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|Catholic priest]], an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] priest, a [[Baptist]] minister, and the [[minister (Christianity)|minister]] who was serving the United Church congregation that eventually came to own the chapel.&lt;ref&gt;Charles W. Johnson and Charles O. Jackson (1981), ''City Behind a Fence: Oak Ridge, Tennessee, 1942-1946''. The University of Tennessee Press. Pages 127-129.&lt;/ref&gt; Its name, &quot;The Chapel on the Hill,&quot; comes from a reference in a prayer by the Knoxville Baptist minister who participated in the dedication.&lt;ref name=Townsite/&gt;

The United Church congregation that is housed in the Chapel on the Hill traces its history to July 18, 1943, when some 25 to 30 Christians of diverse denominational backgrounds gathered for Sunday worship in Oak Ridge's main [[cafeteria]]. Subsequently, several members of the group made plans to establish an interdenominational Protestant church, led by [[laity|layperson]]s, to include all denominations. A [[Presbyterian]] minister working in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] was engaged to conduct weekly services, and about 150 people representing 13 Protestant denominations became charter members of &quot;the United Church&quot;. Governing boards of laypersons elected to lead the new congregation took up their duties on October 24, 1943.&lt;ref name=pre1980&gt;[http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=51&amp;Itemid=55 Pre-1980 Historical Compilation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728093006/http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=51&amp;Itemid=55 |date=July 28, 2011 }}, United Church, Chapel on the Hill website, accessed March 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Chapel-on-the-Hill was completed that same month, the United Church and the local Roman Catholic Church were given control of the building, as the only two churches then officially operating in the [[Manhattan Project]] community. During the war, when Oak Ridge's Manhattan Project facilities were operating around the clock, the chapel building was also in use nearly 24 hours a day as a venue for worship services, [[wedding]]s, and other occasions for local workers of various Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish religious backgrounds.&lt;ref name=pre1980/&gt;

At the peak of wartime activity in Oak Ridge, when the population exceeded 70,000, the United Church employed four ministers and conducted worship services in the Chapel on the Hill, East Village Chapel, and the Jefferson Theater, as well as [[Sunday school]] classes in several local schools and a [[mobile home|trailer]] camp. By 1951, the United Church Chapel-on-the-Hill consolidated as a single [[interdenominational]] congregation, making its home in the Chapel on the Hill building.&lt;ref name=pre1980/&gt;

The United Church congregation purchased the chapel and {{convert|3.72|acre|ha}} of land from the [[U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]] on May 11, 1955 for a price of $17,116.&lt;ref name=pre1980/&gt; An adjoining educational building was added in 1956-1957.

It is felt that the article you created at [[Ethan cavett]] is not suitable for a Wikipedia article, which must have a [[Wikipedia:Notability|notable]] subject and be [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verifiable]]. I have moved it to [[User:{{PAGENAME}}]], which is where users are free to write about themselves. You are at liberty to move it back into the (Main) namespace but bear in mind that if you do so, it is likely to be nominated for deletion. 

Note, however, that the purpose of a user page is to enable active editors of Wikipedia to introduce themselves to other editors. [[WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_a_blog.2C_webspace_provider.2C_or_social_networking_site|Wikipedia is not a general hosting service]], so your user page is not a personal homepage. Content unrelated to Wikipedia or its editing is likely to be removed.

Please see [[WP:User_page|the user page guidelines]], especially [[WP:User_page#What_can_I_not_have_on_my_user_page.3F|this section]] for more information. -- [[User:Omicronpersei8|Omicronpersei8]] ([[User talk:Omicronpersei8|talk]]) 19:36, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

'''Archer''' is a [[slab serif]] typeface designed in 2001 by [[Tobias Frere-Jones]] and [[Jonathan Hoefler]] for use in ''[[Martha Stewart Living]]'' magazine. It was later released by [[Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones]] for commercial licensing.

==Structure==

The typeface is a [[Slab_serif#Geometric_model|geometric]] slab serif, one with a geometric design similar to sans-serif fonts. It takes inspiration from mid-twentieth century designs such as [[Rockwell (typeface)|Rockwell]].

The face is unique for combining the geometric structure of twentieth-century European slab-serifs but imbuing the face with a domestic, less strident tone of voice. [[Ball terminal|Balls]] were added to the upper terminals on letters such as ''C'' and ''G'' to increase its charm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Devroye|first1=Luc|title=Jonathan Hoefler|url=http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-27370.html|publisher=McGill University|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Italic type|Italics]] are true italic designs, with flourishes influenced by calligraphy, an unusual feature for geometric slab serif designs. As with many [[Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones]] designs, it was released in a wide range of weights from hairline to bold, reflecting its design goal as a typeface for complex magazines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Typographica review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Earls|first1=David John|title=Archer|url=http://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/archer/|website=Typographica|accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
The typeface has been used for, among other things, branding for [[Wells Fargo]] and is a main font for the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' and [[Wes Anderson]]'s film ''[[The Grand Budapest Hotel]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=Lauren|title=Is Archer's Use on Target?|url=http://www.aiga.org/is-archers-use-on-target/|publisher=AIGI}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the current font used for titles and body text by the [[Design Observer]] website.

===[[Katisha]]===
Contains no information not in [[The Mikado]] article, the point of the spin-off unclear, as the character only appears in one opera, and it's unclear how this could expand further. In normal circumstances I'd say merge or make it a redirect, but, as I said, everything IS covered in [[The Mikado]], and I can't imagine someone searching for &quot;Katisha&quot;.

*'''Delete''' article per nomination.  Anything notable about this character should appear in the plot summary of ''[[The Mikado]]''.  There is no reason to have a separate article for this character.  -- [[User:Ssilvers|Ssilvers]] 19:59, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Redirect''' it to [[The Mikado]] -- merge isn't needed since the info's there, but the redirect could be useful -- somebody could search for it. -- [[User:ArglebargleIV|ArglebargleIV]] 22:15, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

A tag has been placed on [[:Nonamaker]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article seems to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable [[Wikipedia:Notability|(see the guidelines for notability here)]]. If you can indicate why the subject of this article is notable, you may contest the tagging. To do this, please affix the template &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; to the page and leave a note on [[Talk:Nonamaker|the article's talk page]] explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself.

Please read the [[WP:CSD|criteria for speedy deletion]] (specifically, article #7) and [[Wikipedia:Notability (people)|our general biography criteria]].

== Waterboarding ==

Could you post a link where somebody calls [[surfing]] [[waterboarding]]?  I can't seem to find any. [[User:Jehochman|Jehochman]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Jehochman|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:46, 26 April 2009 (UTC)

Yes, Waterboarding is a very common term in Hawaii, the Western US, Australia and even some former Soviet countries. Here's a link to an article where the author references this http://mydailyclarity.com/2009/03/surfing-for-peace-in-the-gaza/. Also, I found a site that references waterboarding here http://www.hawaiiansouthshore.com/shop/product.php?productid=17375. It get's confusing; I was looking for 'surfing' but we call it Waterboarding so I got to the wrong page ;-)

: Fair enough.  That source uses &quot;water boarding&quot; with a space.  I've made a change to your edit to reflect the space. [[User:Jehochman|Jehochman]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Jehochman|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:23, 26 April 2009 (UTC)</text>

I removed &quot;2006 is only his second full season as a team-manager. It took other team managers, such as [[Frank Williams]] many years to win a grand prix as manager.&quot;

This suggests Fry is responsible for a dramatic turnaround in the team's performance - their 2005 and 2006 performances have been widely acknowledged to have been poor to middling. the circumstances of the Hungarian GP were also exceptional. [[User:Mark83|Mark83]] 19:37, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

::It has been reported in the Telegraph (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/motorsport/formulaone/5369856/Monaco-Grand-Prix-Jenson-Buttons-playboy-days-behind-him.html) that Nick Fry owns a proportion of the team, and in an earlier article, that he owns the majority stake. Shouldn't this be added?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/92.239.225.23|92.239.225.23]] ([[User talk:92.239.225.23|talk]]) 23:17, 28 May 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Klein-Glienicke Schweizerhaus 1.jpg|thumb|320px|''Schweizerhaus'' in [[Klein Glienicke]] near [[Berlin]], designed by [[Ferdinand von Arnim]], 1867]]
'''Swiss chalet style''' ({{lang-de|Schweizerstil}}, {{lang-no|Sveitserstil}}) is an [[architectural style]] of [[Historicism (art)|Late Historicism]], originally inspired by rural [[chalet]]s in [[Switzerland]] and the [[Alps|Alpine]] (mountainous) regions of [[Central Europe]]. The style refers to traditional building designs characterised by widely projecting roofs and facades richly decorated with wooden balconies and carved ornaments. It spread over [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Austria-Hungary]] and [[Scandinavia]] during the ''[[Belle Époque]]'' era.

==History==
[[File:Villa Fridheim, Krøderen, 2.jpg|thumb|Villa Fridheim in [[Krødsherad]], Norway]]
Swiss chalet style originated in the [[German Romanticism|Romantic]] era of the late-18th/early-19th century, when the ideas of the [[English landscape garden]] inspired parks and residences in Germany, such as the [[Dessau-Wörlitz Garden Realm]]. It became highly appreciated on the continent by noble landowners who were impressed by the &quot;simple life&quot; of people living in the mountains. 

The chalet style soon spread over the German ''[[Mittelgebirge]]'' landscapes such as the [[Harz]] mountains or the [[Dresden]] area and the adjacent [[North Bohemia]]n region. As a &quot;modern&quot; building style, it also influenced the [[resort architecture]] along the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] seaside, like in [[Binz]] or [[Heringsdorf, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|Heringsdorf]]. Around 1900, design elements were used in the construction of numerous bourgeois family homes as well as by notable architects like [[Heinrich von Ferstel]] to build larger mansions and hotels. 

The style was further popularized by the first waves of tourism of rich people from the North and West of Europe and became popular in other parts of Europe and North America, notably in the [[architecture of Norway]], [[architecture of Iceland|Iceland]] and [[Architecture of the Netherlands|the Netherlands]] and in the [[country house]] architecture of [[architecture of Sweden|Sweden]] and [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati (Ohio, USA)]], in the late 19th and early 20th century. English examples of the chalet style include the [[Boathouse at Belton House]], [[Lincolnshire]], by [[Anthony Salvin]] and the Swiss Cottage at [[Osbourne House]], on the [[Isle of Wight]], constructed for [[Queen Victoria]]'s children.

==Characteristics==
The style is characterized by:
*[[Gabled roof|Gabled roofs]] with wide [[eaves]]
*Exposed construction beams, including large [[Bracket (architecture)|brackets]]
*Decorative carving and mouldings
*[[Balconies]]
*Large windows
*[[Weatherboarding]], usually painted, often in bright colors

The result was '''delete'''. -- [[User:Jitse Niesen|Jitse Niesen]] ([[User talk:Jitse Niesen|talk]]) 12:28, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

:In case anybody requires an explanation how I arrived at this decision, as it is a bit borderline: There seems to be only one reliable source, an article repeated in USA Today and other media. What tipped the balance is firstly the weak reasons in some of the &quot;keep&quot; comments (specifically, those of necronudist, Portillo, and I don't understand Minfo); and secondly, I think we should be extremely cautious in having articles about living children. -- [[User:Jitse Niesen|Jitse Niesen]] ([[User talk:Jitse Niesen|talk]]) 12:45, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

* '''Delete''' - he's ten years old, for crying out loud. If he makes it as a pro then add him in but not until then. [[User:Qwghlm|Qwghlm]] 20:09, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
**'''Comment''' You can't delete or not delete an article purely based on age. --[[User:Pinkkeith|Pinkkeith]] 20:11, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
***'''Comment''' - the point is that he doesn't meet [[WP:BIO]]. There are thousands of kids with potential; they get articles here when that potential is realised by playing for the first team of a significant club. WP is not a crystal ball. [[User:BlueValour|BlueValour]] 20:53, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
****'''Comment''' Well, that wasn't the point that you made, but it does pass [[WP:BIO]] based on [[WP:GOOGLE]]. There is no crystal ball to this article at all, it is all based on present information and known fact. --[[User:Pinkkeith|Pinkkeith]] 21:00, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
*****'''Comment''' What &quot;known fact?&quot;  There is not a single source cited in the entire article.  I am particularly leery of this becoming another AFD where the article is kept because of references cited in the AFD discussion that never make it into the article thus defeating the entire purpose of this discussion and [[WP:V]].  --[[User:ElKevbo|ElKevbo]] 14:26, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
*We can, however, '''delete''' an article if no reliable sources are provided when challenged under [[WP:V|verifiability policy]].  Pinkkeith, can you point us to featured coverage in mainstream media?  Some of those are needed to let us keep the article.  Being signed to a youth team isn't notable enough to get thousands of other kids their own WP articles.  [[User:Barno|Barno]] 20:39, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
** Here is a [http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/technology/maney/2005-02-01-maney_x.htm USA Today article] on him. In there the writer mentions that he was covered in numerous other newspapers. --[[User:Pinkkeith|Pinkkeith]] 20:43, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
*** - fine but he has achieved nothing in the adult world - the press references are the result of a splendid publicity campaign for his video but that doesn't confer notability. [[User:BlueValour|BlueValour]] 20:57, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
**** That's blatent [[ephebiphobia]]. Reread the article, the entire article is talking about the video and how it made him notable. --[[User:Pinkkeith|Pinkkeith]] 21:01, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

[http://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=%22Jean+Carlos+Chera%22&amp;btnG=Search+Archives&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8 Google News Archive] search yields 74 unique hits- more than enough to qualify as &quot;the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person.&quot; How old the subject is and the method in which he was made notable isn't relevant; the subject meets [[WP:BIO]]. --[[User talk:Rory096|Rory096]] 21:14, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
:*'''Comment''' - most of the content, apart from his birthdate, fails [[WP:V]]. The Ghits mean we can keep the article not that we must. They are all the result of a single video being published on the internet and they have all picked up the same story.

[[User:BlueValour|BlueValour]] 16:58, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''-So he's a child prodigy, that doesn't make him notable.  Some of my friends are amazing at basketball, but they don't have any articles.  As above, if he makes it to the pros (or college, if Brazil has a college league, I dunno), then we can always repost.

*'''Delete'''  When he has played for Manchester United, Arsenal, Porto, Eindhoven or Real Madrid he will have earned his article.  Until then it is worth remembering that, at least in the UK, it would be highly improper for professional clubs to express an interest in a 10 year old, let alone to 'openly court' them.

*'''Delete''' I've reviewed some of these news articles. I can read only the English ones, which are basically the same novelty one-shot story, repeated, or something like the USA today story, which is more about how everyone is famous on the Internet than a biographical source for an article.

Many of the users are very bias against the idea of a 7yr old having its own article or the fact that his only a child prodigy, but indeed we have a child prodigy article. Im definately getting a sense of outright bias and a feeling that many of the voters here are americans. [[portillo]]

*'''Comment''' - I think most of the delete (and some of the keep) votes are completely missing the point. Of course this kid isn't a notable footballer. He is however notable as an internet/media phenomenon. Wikipedia has plenty of articles for such people, as an example go look at [[Mahir Çağrı]]. Then at the bottom of his page have a look at the categories he's placed in. When someone comes to Wikipedia and searches for &quot;that kid i saw clips of on TV&quot; or &quot;that kid my mate sent me videos of&quot; and who's name give 35,000 google hits... He should be here! [[User:Alii h|aLii]] 15:20, 6 November 2006 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' per norm. [[User:Minfo|м info]] 23:03, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - I wonder if there is a misunderstanding here? If you are a child prodigy as a piano player you can play the piano. If you are a child prodigy as a mathematician you can do complicated sums in your head. Here, the kid undoubtedly has unusual ball skills but that doesn't make him a footballer. I also don't see him as a 'internet/media phenomenon' with any longevity - with YouTube such phenonima come and go like snow in the sun. [[User:TerriersFan|TerriersFan]] 00:01, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
:He was born as a YouTube phenomen but now he's known by all of the users above, has google entries and BBC articles. Guys, you wanna delete him, let's do it. Simply there are people who search for him and people who know him, there are many articles on paper magazines about him, but if you are too zealous to keep a 9-years-old top-youngster 'cause &quot;well, dear Watson, it fails WP:BIO =_= ahem&quot; let's do it. Do it and stop arguing bullshits. --[[User:Necronudist|necronudist]] 09:24, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

The '''European Federation of [[Financial Analyst]]s Societies''' ('''EFFAS''')[http://www.effas.com] is the federation of [[financial analyst|analysts]] associations in Europe. EFFAS comprises 27 member societies representing more than 14,000 investment professionals. EFFAS was founded in 1962 and the headquarters is located in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]].

Besides its European training programme CEFA (Certified European Financial Analyst) EFFAS also grants the Certified International Investment Analysts (CIIA) designation, ensuring professional qualification by offering global as well as local market knowledge within its examination structure. As a global designation the exams can be taken in different languages. Through the national member societies EFFAS provides a full range of services for capital market experts.

==CIIA Certification==
EFFAS participates in further developing the [[Certified International Investment Analyst]] (CIIA) examinations, a financial analyst designation recognised globally. Analysts who belong to European analyst associations that are members of EFFAS, are eligible to participate in the final CIIA examination, if they pass the foundation and the national exams, or if they hold the Certified European Financial Analyst diploma (CEFA).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Big Andy, (Andrew Walsh) was born in Louisville, Ky., on Feb. 12, 1978.  His father, Frank Walsh and mother, Marsha Sils were overly delighted to have him, since their first son, Patrick, was a dud.  Big Andy was known through his childhood as being pretty funny.  His brother, not so much.  His parents divorced in 1981, after his father recuperated from emergency brain surgery, after falling through the roof at his work and landing head first on the concrete below.  He continued to work there until he passed away after a 3 year battle with melanoma, in 2006, a week before his 54th birthday.  His mom remarried and had another child, a daughter named Brittani (Gamble).</text>

{{Wikipedia subcat guideline|notability criteria|{{PAGENAME}}|[[WP:NMS]]&lt;br&gt;[[WP:SCIENCE]]}}
--&gt;
{{rejected}}

Ideas related to science are an important part of any comprehensive [[WP:ENC|encyclopedia]].  This guideline and its criteria are intended for use in determining whether a topic is notable due to being a part of or related to science.  The tests in this guideline are intended to be fairly rigirous so that a topic that is acceptable under this guideline can be considered an appropriate part of Wikipedia.  However, the failure of a topic to meet this guideline's criteria does not automatically exclude it, as it may attain notability through [[WP:N]] itself or another of its subsidiary guidelines.

==Notability of topics related to science==

The need for this guideline comes from there being a set of topics which do not fail the test of the [[Wikipedia:No original research|No original research]] policy or the [[Wikipedia:Attribution]] policy but which none the less are not appropriate to Wikipedia because they do have sufficient notability.  Such topics mostly represent new findings and theories, as well as past findings and theories that have failed to gain significant attention in either scientific circles or the public at large (or so far failed to gain said attention).

A key element to understanding this guideline is that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a research publication, and as such Wikipedia does not usurp the usual validation processes of scientific institutions such as [[peer review]], [[scientific consensus]], and academic recognition. Decisions about including or excluding material must always reflect the opinions of outside authorities, not those of Wikipedia editors. Inclusion or exclusion is therefore not a judgement on the validity, importance or accuracy of a scientific contribution, but simply a reflection of the quality and quantity of responses it received inside and outside the [[scientific community]].

This [[WP:N|notability guideline]] derives its relevance from the policies [[WP:NOT|What Wikipedia is not]] (in particular [[WP:NOT#IINFO|Not an indiscriminate collection of information]] and [[WP:NOT#CRYSTALBALL|Not a crystal ball]]), [[WP:NOR|No original research]] and [[WP:NPOV|Neutral point of view]] (in particular [[WP:NPOV#Undue weight|Undue weight]] and [[Wikipedia:Neutral point  of view/FAQ#Pseudoscience|Pseudoscience]]), as well as the guidelines [[Wikipedia:Conflict of interest|Conflict of interest]] and [[WP:AUTO|Autobiography]]. Also of importance are [[WP:V|verifiability]] and [[WP:RS|reliability]] policies.

==Criteria==
=== General ===
In general, a contribution in the field of science is notable enough to merit inclusion in Wikipedia if it meets at least one of the following criteria:

#'''Textbook science.''' There is regular non-incidental mention of the contribution in general or specialized textbooks published by reputable presses.{{ref|1|1}}
#'''Widely cited.''' Papers covering the contribution have been widely cited{{ref|2|2}} in its research field{{ref|3|3}} relative to other papers in the same area. Self-citations, and citations in journals which are not respected within the relevant research field should be excluded.
#'''Press and fiction.''' It is or was well known due to extensive press coverage, or due to being a recurrent theme in notable works of [[fiction]]. In this case the article should make note of this status. A single article on the theory, even if from a major media source such as ''[[New Scientist]]'' or ''[[Scientific American]]'', is not a sufficient criterion.
#'''Historical interest.''' It has historically met any of the above criteria within the scientific community or the culture at large but has since either been [[superseded scientific theory|superseded]], disregarded, or dismissed by the scientific community or the culture at large. The article should make note of the subject's status in this regard.
#'''Popular belief.''' It is or was believed to be true by a significant part of the general population, even if rejected by scientific authorities.

Notable topics which are primarily non-scientific in nature but which contain claims concerning scientific phenomena, should not be handled as scientific.  For example, the ''[[Book of Genesis]]'' itself is primarily covered as a religious scripture rather than as a cosmology. On the other hand, subjects such as [[creationism]] or [[creation science]], which involve a direct conflict between scientific and religious doctrine, are properly evaluated both on a scientific and theological basis. Similarly, subjects purporting to have a scientific basis may be noteworthy primarily on cultural or sociological bases, such as UFOs, which can usefully be discussed from several different perspectives.

:{{Seealso|Wikipedia:Notability (science)/Irrelevant arguments}}

===Scientific terms===
:''See also [[Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms]]
A scientific term is considered notable and worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia if the following can be established:
# A commonly agreed-upon formal or informal definition
# A trajectory of use for the term in the scientific literature from [[WP:RS|reliable]] and [[WP:V|verifiable]] sources
To determine notability it is important to keep in mind that different fields sometimes use the same term to describe different concepts. On the other hand, especially in the early stages of a field, terminology is often not standardized and different terms are used for the same concept. The policy on [[WP:NAME|naming conventions]] gives more information on the choice of the proper term when more than one term is used in the scientific literature.

== Assessing the reliability and relevance of sources ==

Journals from which citations and evidence of notability are obtained are expected to be well known and respected within the relevant research field.  The previous requirement of citation from a peer-reviewed source is not alone sufficient by this requirement.  (Peer review is done just as easily by a fringe science journal as by a leading journal, while [[Nature (journal)|Nature magazine]], one of the most respected [[scientific journals]] in existence, uses editorial as well as  peer review for submissions.)

Textbooks should either be well-known and respected or produced by a reputable scientific publisher (which is most likely the same publisher as one or more respected journals).

Journals from scientific societies of developing countries are occasionally not reliable.  If a finding in such a journal should prove to be of great scientific interest, that finding is often reprinted and/or reported in reliable scientific sources.  In such a case, the original journal article can be cited as a primary source, but its relevance should be backed up by secondary citations in known reliable sources.

For biographical articles and articles on fringe science, there is some loosening of these requirements.  Works by the topic of a biographical article are relevant to the article whether their writing was published in a reliable journal/publisher or not.  Also, the contents of a journal devoted to a fringe science can provide evidence as to the past or current thinking within that fringe field.  However, the fringe science journals cannot provide evidence for the outright notability of the topic.

==Notes==
{{note|1|Note 1}}:  The scientific contribution must have a major entry in the work. A passing mention of the concept is not sufficient. 

{{note|2|Note 2}}:  Citation counts and peer review mechanisms differ vastly between sciences, fields, and subfields, and editors are urged to inform the relevant [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Council/Directory/Science|WikiProject]] about ongoing debates to get expert input. It should also be noted that ''quantity'' of citations is often only a poor approximation of ''quality''.

{{note|3|Note 3}}:  A &quot;research field&quot; indicates an established area of study for which the topic in question is only a part.  A topic cannot be its own research field, nor can it gain notability from being part of a field which is non-notable.

__NOTOC__
===Overview===
After much deliberation of the [[Wikipedia:Danny's contest/Contest entries|contest entries]] the judges have arrived at a decision.

The entries could be broken down into three broad groups... entries that didn't seem to have much, if any, improvement, entries that were a &quot;good try&quot; and a handful of entries that really took the contest to heart and added a lot of interesting and germane references.

===Criteria===
The judges graded on 4 major criteria:
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!Criterion
!Description
!Weight
|-
|'''Number of citations'''
|Just a  raw count of how many were added. This was a good filter to see if the article could make the finalists... only 2 or 3 refs suggested that maybe not so much had been done.  
|(20%)
|-
|'''Complexity of citations'''
|A gauge of the difficulty level of adding them. Were they notes? web cites? book cites? did they use ISBN tagging? were there multiple places that got the same note? Notes ON notes? 
|(30%)
|-
|'''Appropriateness of cites'''
|Were they actually GOOD cites that moved the article forward?
|(20%)  
|-
|'''Overall article improvement'''

|'''[[Battle of Ceresole]]'''
|An important battle in medieval history, part of the [[Italian Wars]] series. Characterised by contemporaries as &quot;marvellously confused&quot; this battle is attractively illustrated with lots of maps and diagrams. One would expect Kyrill as coordinator of [[WP:MILHIST]] to do a good job of improving an article, and Kyrill does not disappoint. A very powerful article about an interesting battle.

|'''[[Theramenes]]'''
|An important general and historical figure of ancient Greece, including participating in an Athenian coup, multiple battles, and a rebellion. He even had notoriety after death. The article is challenging due to a paucity of sources, but Robth found 80+ cites. There also is an innovative organisation of sources into modern and ancient. A very good article based on some painstaking research.

|'''[[Crawford expedition]]'''
|A very understudied but important battle in the [[American Revolution]]. The winning side often tends to ignore battles they lost, and this article was not much more than a single paragraph stub when Kevin went to town on it. It is now profusely illustrated with maps, paintings, tables and diagrams and has grown to 43 Kb. In addition to 88 high quality footnotes, it also has a comprehensive &quot;references&quot; and &quot;for further reading&quot; section, properly separated out. All books have good ISBN links. This article is a real tour de force and shows the power of our encyclopedia well.

That all of these articles were somehow military related was surely coincidence! :)

'''Joe Eubanks''' (born 1975) is an [[United States|American]] [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] best known by the [[ring name]] '''Lobo'''. He wrestled primarily in [[Combat Zone Wrestling]] (CZW), where he won every major championship and was the first inductee into the [[CZW Hall of Fame]] in 2004. He was formerly the CZW Commissioner/Talent Coordinator.&lt;ref name=&quot;Online World of Wrestling&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/040207.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling 5th Anniversary Show February 7, 2004 - Philadelphia, Pennsylvania - ECW Arena|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===1999-2002===
Along with [[Nick Gage]], [[Justice Pain]], and [[Ric Blade]], Lobo was trained by [[John Zandig]] at the CZW Wrestling School and graduated first in the class.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freewebs.com/andy_czw1/history.html CZWHookup : The history of CZW] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210134119/http://www.freewebs.com/andy_czw1/history.html |date=2008-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He became one of the main wrestlers in CZW along with other graduates from the school. In February 1999, Lobo became the second [[CZW Iron Man Championship|Iron Man Champion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Online World of Wrestling&quot;/&gt; He held the title until June when he lost it to Justice Pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/990619.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling - CZW Down in Flames June 19, 1999 - Mantua, NJ |accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two continued wrestling each other and competed in the first ever Cage of Death match at the first ''Cage of Death'' show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/991016.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling - CZW Cage of Death October 16, 1999 - Mantua, NJ|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lobo won the match and regained the title. He would lose this title to [[Matt Prince|Wifebeater]], but regain it one more time the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/000311.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling - CZW March Violence March 11, 2000 - Sewell, NJ|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lobo also challenged for the [[CZW World Heavyweight Championship|CZW Heavyweight Championship]]. He feuded with Zandig for the title and finally beat him in July 2000. He held the title until ''Cage of Death II''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/000909.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling - CZW Cage of Death II....After Dark September 9, 2000 - Sewell, NJ|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that show, Lobo successfully defended the championship against Zandig in the Cage of Death match. Directly following this match, Justice Pain came out and fought Lobo in another Cage of Death match. In the match, Lobo was thrown from the top of the cage to the ground through a table covered in barbed wire. Justice Pain went on to win the match and the title.&lt;ref name=&quot;Online World of Wrestling&quot;/&gt;  After losing the title, Lobo continued feuding with Zandig. This time, the feud was for ownership of CZW. On February 9, 2002, Lobo defeated Zandig to become the new owner of CZW. He held this position until ''Cage of Death IV'' when Zandig defeated him to regain his position as CZW's owner &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/021213.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling December 13, 2002 - Philadelphia, PA - Viking Hall|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2003-present===
He took some time off from CZW following the Cage of Death match. While he was gone, a new group called the Hi-V tried to take over CZW, with Zandig as their main target. Zandig was planning to face the Hi-V at ''Cage of Death V'', but the stable outnumbered his team 6 to 4. At ''Night of Infamy II'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/031115.html|title=Night of Infamy II - November 15, 2003 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lobo made a shocking return to help Zandig and join his team just in time for Cage of Death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/031213.html|title=Cage of Death V December 13, 2003 - Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their team was successful. In February 2004, Lobo became the first inductee to the CZW Hall of Fame. After this, Lobo remained inactive for the following two years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Online World of Wrestling&quot;/&gt;

At [[Cage of Death 7]], [[Zandig]], who had turned on the fans, wanted to run CZW the way they used to. He called out Lobo, who was backstage for the event, and they joined each other along with [[Justice Pain]] and [[Nick Gage]]. They would later call themselves the Forefathers of CZW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/_2006/|title=2006 results

*'''Speedy Delete''' - for blatant advertising.  I waited a bit to see how this one would play out before making a decision, but as much good faith as I normally assume, there is no sticking up for this one.  The article's [[User:Kobius|prime editor]] (and incidentally, the forum admin) removed the AfD tag from the page and does not take kindly to other editors touching 'his' page.  The whole layout of the article is clearly trying to draw viewers into the forums, perhaps to meet the admitted goal of 500,000 posts.  Add these to the issues others have pointed out and there's really no need for further discussion.

The Anizone is a large site and I think if someone wants to find out more about it they come to the best internet dictionary in the world and they research on of the largest best sites. The site has a largely amount of fair people considering it has been hacked three times. The admin accidently remoe it thinking it would be delete and he was not the maker of the page but it was I.

==BBC News Report and the pilot &quot;looking for a good place to crash&quot;==

The BBC article states that the pilot was looking for a good place to put the aircraft down; he missed some park and instead put the aircraft down in an uninhabited area near Stockport city centre. The evidence does not justify this supposition whatsoever. For one thing, the AIB report states that the aircraft was likely uncontrollable after the engines cut out, and might not have been controllable even before then. The first officer died and the captain suffered retrograde amnesia, so we don't know what went on in the cockpit. There isn't the tiniest shred of evidence that the pilot &quot;put the aircraft down&quot; someplace safe. It was likely just coincidence - there are a lot of empty or disused areas around airports and under approach paths (and *that* is often deliberate).

This is such a common urban legend/media foofah. Every time a plane doesn't actually fall out of the sky, some media type comes up and says the pilot was &quot;looking for a place to crash that wouldn't cause injuries on the ground&quot;. I don't blame the Wikipedian who put this in at all, because he/she likely didn't have any sources other than the BBC article. I am blaming the BBC for making a supposition not supported by the facts.

I suppose people want to think that in an emergency the first thing the pilot will do is look for a safe place to crash. It makes them feel less worried about an aircraft crashing into their home, school, or place of business. It ain't necessarily so, though; in fact it almost is never so. Aircraft about to crash are more often than not uncontrollable - that's why they crash. --[[User:Charlene.fic|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot; face=&quot;Matisse ITC&quot;&gt;Charlene&lt;/font&gt;]] 19:40, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

Edited to add: The cause of the accident wasn't &quot;pump failure&quot; (boo, BBC, again). It was a design error in the fuel line. --[[User:Charlene.fic|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot; face=&quot;Matisse ITC&quot;&gt;Charlene&lt;/font&gt;]] 20:02, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

:Apologies. That would have been my factual faux pas. Thank you for correcting my blathering and making this article respectable. :) [[User:Legion89|Legion]] 13:56, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

A second's more flight and the plane would catastrophically have taken the tower off Stockport's fine Town Hall and crashed into the facade of the (then) infirmary opposite the Town Hall, blocking the main road between that runs from Manchester through Stockport to the south - AG, Stockport.

== Additional cause of this crash ==

I remember seeing a BBC program about this crash. It reported on the findings of the inquiry. It said that there was an additional reason for the crash.

Apparently, the engine speeds were shown in the cockpit on two dials, one for each wing. Each dial had two hands, one for each engine and each labelled with the engine number.

This had been serviced, and a mistake had been made so that engine 3 was connected to the hand marked &quot;4&quot;, and engine 4 to hand &quot;3&quot;.

I think it was engine 4 that was starved of fuel. The pilot saw from the dial that engine 3 had stopped, so he switched off / feathered engine 3. Now both engines on the right wing were out. (This would explain why engine 4 was windmilling.)

As part of the investigation, they tried flying a similar aircraft with engines 3 and 4 both out, and discovered that the aircraft could not be flown properly.

Now, I mention all this because it is an interesting story. Also, because I want to apply the moral to setting up a computer cluster. I want to avoid the possibility of one computer failing and a different one being taken out for service by mistake, thereby bringing down the cluster. 

Does anyone know more about this? [[User:Mm67|Mm67]] 11:44, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

==Is [[Wikipedia:Notability (science)]] a consensus guideline?==
Please state your position, '''yes''' or '''no''', explain your position and defend it.  This is not a vote.  [[User:SmokeyJoe|SmokeyJoe]] 10:47, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Yes''' I consider it one, and I'm not sure what objection people have - if there's a problem that needs fixing, let's fix it.  I already refer to it, guideline or not, since it's very useful.  --[[User:Minderbinder|Minderbinder]] 12:38, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Yes''' Not only is it a consensus guideline, it is absolutely vital for Wikipedia to have such a guideline. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 12:51, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Yes''' I certainly support this guideline, what it is trying to do, and how it is trying to achieve it. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:10, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Yes''' We're ready to go into the stage where changes should be discussed here before being implemented in the policy page. ~ [[User:Trialsanderrors|trialsanderrors]] 17:40, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Absolutely''' We've numerous AfDs and arbcom cases which have documented that this is the community's intent. --[[User:EngineerScotty|EngineerScotty]] 17:44, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* I don't see where the proposed criteria add meaningful advice to writters or evaluators, and the preamble/text is way too long to be practical.  Please cite some examples of AfD where this proposal would have ensured an outcome other than what would have been achieved under the current guidelines.  For each of the criteria now listed I belive that proper application of WP:N and WP:ATT would acheive the same results.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 17:54, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
** There is [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Electric universe (concept)]], where this standard helped to refine the arguments that finally got the topic removed.  The aupporters trying to use this guideline to buoy their cause ended up only showing all the more that the article did not belong in Wikipedia.  &lt;br&gt;You are correct that in the end articles that are removed will be so removed (or not) due to policy concerns.  The need for this guideline comes from its ability to focus the debate on the issues that are important in the relevant cases.  In other words, it helps to achieve the &quot;proper application&quot; that you are claiming makes this guideline irrelevant. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 18:22, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
*** EMS, could your purpose be acheived with an essay?  Among the problems with permutations from guidelines and policies is the evolution into redundant and conficting guidance to the point that writers and evaluators become confused and the branches work at cross purposes.  My frequent analogy is the US Tax Code, which has bread several large industries for interpretation and application.  Writing complex rule sets requires great skill and caution. --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 18:34, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
*** On review of the Electric universe (concept) AfD, it appears to be resoundingly rejected with the tools we already have, most convincingly original research and few reliable sources.  This outcome is consistent with other scientific and academic issues which I have seen defeated at AfD. An excellent nomination doesn't hurt either! --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 18:42, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
**** Right now I am wondering what your agenda is here, as this type of opposition usually comes from someone who has lost an AfD in part due to this and the guidelines and is seeking to water down the standards.  One of the factors that helped with the electric universe AfD was the the nominator was also working on this guideline and used its insights in writing the nom.  Beyond that, there is the basic issue of moving beyond &quot;peer review&quot; as a standard for inclusion, a test passed by numerous non-notable articles that I have seen.  Also, I at least have gone to some pains to couch this as a setting standard for inclusions instead of exclusion.  That way, an argument that &quot;X calls for inclusion&quot; renders this guideline moot as a refutation, and so avoids the types of conflicts that in our laws make being a lawyer such a profitable profession. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 19:16, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
***** My agenda is not as you assert, but your question is a fair one, which I will answer.  My agenda is clarity in the grand scheme of notability guidelines, without a specific prejudice to this proposal. Please visit the discussion page for WP:N to see that there are many people expressing concerns over the whole process.  I support the concept of &quot;encyclopedic suitability&quot;, which we call notablility at WP, for lack of a better name.  I also consider myself a moderate inclusionist.  I am a frequent participant in Afd.  You are correct in one respect, that I origninally became involved in AfD and notability, because I saw too many abuses by uninformed editors who were deleting meanigful articles, though not specifically in the field of science.  My interest is in history and sailing.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 19:33, 16 March 2007 (UTC) 
******Might I recommend that your &quot;no&quot; comment seems to be motivated more by a general dislike for [[WP:N]] rather than a specific distaste for this particular guideline. In particular, the motivation behind this guideline was in part due to a charge made during the [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Pseudoscience|Pseudoscience arbitrartion case]] that such a guideline should exist to fend off charges related to whether an idea was notable in a scientific sense. One can argue whether [[WP:N]] should exist or not, but that's not for us to decide here. It is absolutely not true that this guideline is redudant: there is no other place where it is indicated what makes a scientific idea notable for inclusion in the encyclopedia. [[WP:NOR]] doesn't help because &quot;originality&quot; is a vague concept related to heavily to [[WP:V]] and [[WP:COI]] to be useful when people just make random articles about ostensibly scientific subjects they read about online, for example. [[WP:A]] doesn't help because there are scientific ideas which are not notable (the general consensus of the community is that they do not belong in the encyclopedia) which nevertheless are attributable to reliable sources. [[WP:NPOV]] doesn't work because the exclusion criteria at [[WP:NPOV#Undue weight]] is unable to distinguish between majority and minority except by [[WP:CON|consensus]]. That's why this guideline is needed and why it is used. Look at all the pages that link here and tell me that it isn't referred to. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 13:09, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
* No, it's not.  I think the burden of some evidence that this guideline is widely supported and necessary needs to be shown from the supporters.  Right now it's an initiative, a proposal with stable wording.  However, even in the &quot;test cases&quot; that I looked at, it seems that this guideline isn't being referred to, and evaluation of the articles in question isn't done with these guidelines in mind, rather, articles are mainly evaluated from a point of view of adequate sourcing and original research issues, in other words, policies we already have.  (I do think the editors here have reached a reasonably stable consensus, though.  But that doesn't, to me, make a &quot;consensus guideline,&quot; which implies support from the community overall.)[[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:04, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
**The evidence is in the ''What links here'' tool you can access from the toolbox. I think that you may have a hidden agenda here: you tend to be a bit too quick to agree to a supression bias against non-experts in the fields of science. Is this a misplaced concern? --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 13:09, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
***First of all there are over 150 things that link to [[Wikipedia:Notability (science)]], so it's not unreasonable to expect evidence to be actually gathered by someone trying to make a case.  But more, I went to a few of those &quot;what links here&quot; and apparently the only reason they were linked was that trialsanderrors mentioned that the debate was a test case: not people actually referring to the guideline and trying to use it.  Look at the Electric Universe AfD, for instance, which is the best example I've seen of a borderline-notable scientific theory (where this guideline might help).  [[WP:SCIENCE]] was not used as an argument in the debate, even by you, and the arguments that led to it being deleted were not even much along the lines of what is presented here in the guideline, but were according to core Wikipedia policies like [[WP:ATT]], [[WP:OR]] and so on.  Some of the argument is covered here in the introduction, but the &quot;criteria&quot; part played no role and seems to be central to this as a notability guideline.  So, this is what I mean when I say that no evidence has been presented.  What do YOU mean when you say this is a consensus guideline?  [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:43, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
****The criteria part played a huge role. The only criteria that EU could have come close to satisfying was recognition in popular culture/outside media and we showed that it was not notable along those lines. The guidelines at the time were being formulated and weren't as clear as they are now, but thanks to discussions such as that AfD we have a clearer demarcation. I think you need to read through the AfD we reference again and look carefully at how the criteria line-up with the criteria outlined in this guideline. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:02, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
*****Could you show me precisely where?  I don't mean to be dense, but I really don't see it.  I see your point #5 in the nomination, but that sounds like the core [[WP:N]] argument, and not related to the criteria here.  And anyway, saying the the EU debate influenced [[WP:SCIENCE]] kind of precludes that the EU debate can be thought of as evidence that this is a consensus guideline.  Can you show me ANY AfD debate that explicitly references the criteria?  [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:17, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
******Number 5 in the nomination. While it doesn't explicitly reference this page, it does so implicitly (and if I recall correctly at the time the standards were still being developed as to which criteria were going to be grouped with which). --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:20, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
*******Again, #5 was really along the lines of basic [[WP:N]].  Again, show me any debates that explicitly reference the criteria.  There's a difference between this proposal being wise or balanced or sensible and it having ''broad community support.''  [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:44, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
********Basic [[WP:N]]&quot;? That's a bit of WikiLawyering I haven't come across before. The fact is that #5 has direct parallels to our criteria here. You can thrust your head in the sand over this all you want, but that's the plain truth of the matter. And now you reposition your attack to claim that there isn't &quot;broad community support&quot;, but let me remind you that arbcomm members entreatied the community to develop these standards in the first place and that by virtue of this being a Wiki it will end up as balanced and sensible as possible. I'm beginning to think you are being a stick-in-the-mud for reasons you aren't coming clean about. Help me out, explain to me why you always seem to be fighting against scientific accuracy at Wikipedia so I can [[WP:AGF|assume good faith]] towards your contributions. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 17:36, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
***I suggest you go read [[WP:AGF]] and actually take it to heart.  In our current discussion, you seem to have trouble differentiating between (1) my personal support or opposition of the proposal and (2) my arguing that the proposal isn't a &quot;consensus guideline&quot;, that is, that it doesn't have broad support.  This wouldn't be a very hard difference to understand if you had been assuming good faith of me in the first place.  For the record, I support some of what the proposal says but not all of it, but that wasn't the basis for my objections: calling the proposal a &quot;consensus guideline&quot; is wrong, because this is still a very new proposal, barely even stable enough to judge.  [[WP:PROF]] remained a proposal for a very long time, and finally became a guideline when it became apparent that the guideline had influenced the way decisions were being made, and that the community, de facto, embraced the guideline.  Creation of policies and guidelines is slow and for good reason, especially when actionable changes are being proposed (like the criteria here).

****I appreciate your candor regarding your opinions of the content of this guideline because that is precisely what concerns me. However, I do feel that you are being a bit oblique in your commentary. &quot;Policy creation is slow,&quot; is often the cry of those who want to slow things down, and people tend to drag their feet for a reason. To me and many of the other editors who commented above, this guideline is ''de facto'' in place and isn't a proposal because we as editors abide by it. As you know, Wikipedia policies and guidelines are not written to affect change in the encyclopedia, but rather are meant to describe what actively goes on in editing. A good number of those who say that this is a consensus guideline edit a lot of science-related articles and so should be the ones to tell whether or not this guideline applies. I don't see that you are actively doing this as such. I do see you stepping into disputes regarding science-related articles often, and there are many times I see these actions as being in something of a contravention of the guidelines outlined here. I am being very up-front about my distrust of your motivations, but in so doing I'm also trying to assume good-faith as much as I can. Part of assuming good-faith is being transparent about one's perceptions and I'm offering you the opportunity to explain yourself as transparently as possible so we can move on. I don't like being lectured about [[WP:AGF]] when I was the one who brought it up, it looks to me like you are asking me to turn a blind eye towards our long history here at the encyclopedia and I am honestly telling you I'm having a hard time doing it because of the nature of this particular dispute we're having. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 13:53, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
*****You are making false implications about me, and I want it to stop.  [[WP:CIV|Comment on my comments]].  You say this is an attempt to document how Wikipedia works?  I respectfully disagree -- this talk page and its archives are full of debates about what the criteria ''should'' be, with very little discussion or analysis of how things are actually decided now.  (Some, but not much.)  From perusing the test cases, it seems to me that people are nearly exclusively deciding on these cases on the basis of [[WP:OR]], [[WP:ATT]], and [[WP:NPOV]], (and to a degree, [[WP:N]]), without much need for arguments specific to issue that the topics under discussion are scientific ones.  Since that ''isn't'' the content of this proposal, I cannot agree that this is documenting current Wikipedia practice, but if you want to try to change my mind, please show me specific examples so we can discuss them.  In any case, you should advertise this debate on [[WP:VPR]]; the general Wikipedia community should have a chance to comment.

******Whether they are false or not, they are simply my questions regarding your, frankly, obstinate resistance to this particular document. I am trying to be as forthright as possible here, and your increasingly haughty responses only confuse me further since you still haven't addressed directly my concerns regarding the history we have surrounding issues such as this. I disagree that the discussions are centering around how things &quot;should&quot; be. Rather I see discussions centering around generalizing from the experience that editors have. You also seem to be under the opinion that just because people reference older and more established policies and guidelines they aren't also considering this guideline. This I find to be particularly problematic because it ignores the words of people that aren't appended with a WP-acronym. Just because somebody doesn't cite this directly doesn't mean that you can't see the criteria being applied (as per our earlier discussion on EU deletion). I would hope that you would look more closely at the deletion discussions surrounding this and see if you can't spot the criteria in action. I am not going to advertise the debate anywhere, but you are free to do so. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 16:27, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
*******I've advertised the debate at [[WP:VPR]].  In terms of the status: you see one thing, I see another thing.  I'm not going to change my opinion by simply being told &quot;please look more closely,&quot; although you could convince me if you actually showed me some evidence.  I do see a lot of attempts at guiding the community: take a look at [[#&quot;Conference topic&quot; is a backdoor]], for instance, or [[#One final thought]]: people are discussing how to make a good rule, not what the rule is, organically.

****I'm with SA here: [[WP:N]] is being criticized partly because of its extreme generality.  No reason to think the entire idea of notability for all topics must pause just because of that.

****  The problem lies less with any individual sub-guideline, but more with a plethora of permutations leading to confusion.

***** I don't see any bedlam here.  I see this as being a well crafted guideline that is dealing with issues which are out-of-scope for the more general guideline due to its broad nature.  This guideline deals with the issues of science and science-related topics, and how to implement the notability guidelines within that context.&lt;br&gt;I have looked at the [[WP:N]] discussion and I get the feeling that you are doing your best to create uncertainty and confusion there.  And now you are trying to do the same here.  I for one have no need for it, and support this guideline as a reflection of the legitimate sense of the science editors here as to what is valid. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 18:23, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
*Yes, this appears to be a consensus guideline. The opposition to this guideline proposal may be part of a campaign in which User:Kevin Murray in the past month has placed &quot;rejected&quot; , &quot;disputed&quot; , or &quot;historical&quot; , or &quot;essay&quot; labels on about a dozen notability proposals or guidelines or has nominated them for deletion on the grounds that there was no consensus or that they constituted &quot;instruction creep&quot; or were redundant. A proposal is not necessarily impossible to reach consensus upon just because a few editors oppose it.

** I see your point.  This editor really, really has a grudge against the concept of notability, and I would love to know why.  If you want to do a [[WP:RfC]] against him, I am will be happy to second it.  This is ridiculous. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 19:42, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
*** No EMS, this editor, has a &quot;grudge&quot; against needless and redundant rule making for the sake of rule making.  I strongly support the concept of encyclopedic suitability which we call &quot;notability&quot; at WP.  This is not &quot;ridiculous&quot; but based on observations from life experience, that too many conficting rules create confusion rather than clarity.  Complex rule-sets require incredible cross coordination among the permutations, which is not happening here at WP, as guidelines are multiplying like rabbits without consideration of the big picture.  If you propose an RfC, please do so in the best interest of WP, not &quot;against&quot; me; this is not personal and reviewing the discussions will reveal that my actions are well supported.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 14:18, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
****There are plenty of Wikipedians who [[WP:IAR|agree with you about hating rules]]. However, might I suggest that you are going about it the wrong way. We are here writing this guideline because we need to summarize what has been done in regards to this issue. Your own personal distaste for the way in which editors have gone about doing this is probably best argued elsewhere: it certainly has nothing to do with whether consensus exists for this particular guideline. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:29, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
*** I do not see '''any''' need to coordinate this guideline with any other guidelines beside [[WP:N]] itself.  Although I am doing my own &quot;[[WP:NOR|original research]]&quot;, I have seem enough -uh- &quot;stuff&quot; offered by others such that I see a need to draw a firm and reasonable as to what is and is not acceptable here.  Until it has some reasonable amount of recognition in the scientific community, I see an article on my ideas as being an abuse of Wikipedia.  Yet I am unusual in that most other editors of Wikipedia with alternate ideas are here to promote those ideas, and they hate guidelines like this one with a purple passion because they help to keep their OR out.&lt;br&gt;BTW - I do see where you have had some success with you anti-Notability campaign.  Personally I think that you are doing Wikipedia a real disservice with it, and what you are stifling is not a bunch useless rule-making but instead needed elaborations on the meaning of Notability in various domains.  As has been noted in [[Wikipedia_talk:Notability|the WP:N discussion]], there is a level of subjectiveness in determining notability.  The need for these subsidary guidelines is to limit that subjectiveness, and thereby make this concept more usable.  Instead you are trying to pull the rug out from under Notability, something that will make the removal of questionable material much more difficult than it should be. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 16:08, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''the real test''' is whether the guidelines here will be accepted in practice. Both the above positions are to some degree correct: the guideline should reflect what its eds. believe to be the common feeling of the community, but it shouldalso point in the direction of where the consensus appears to be moving, and to be making recommendations from those most involved in edited these articles to guide thos less familiar. I think it will prove to be accepted because it is relatively straightforward, not complex -- at least by comparison -- and, in my view it does reflect the general voice. But we shall see. 
::The real dispute , I think, is over the notability of fringe science and whether that can be considered science in any sense at all. This is a matter in which I think there is in fact no real consensus, but at best a temporary majority, and i expect this  question to continue to be the theme of AfDs. I don't think this guideline  lays it to rest '''[[User:DGG|DGG]]''' 23:36, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
::: This guideline cannot and should not judge whether something is &quot;real science&quot;.  In fact, all that a determination that something is &quot;not science&quot; can do here is to remove a topic from being judged by this criteria with no resolution on its notability or lack thereof.  IMO, we have a set of criteria here such that anything that is meant to be judged as part of science can be ruled on here, be it mainstream or fringe.  What I think that you will find is that the least palatable topics are those which also have had the least impact and are also therefore the least notable.  --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 01:53, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

== Some suggestions on organizing this project page ==

* The introduction is too long.  Limit it to &quot;what&quot; and &quot;why&quot;.  Get the commentary (i.e. &quot;impetus&quot;) and discussion of process into its own section.  Specifically address what makes ''science'' different from other areas covered by the general guidelines.
* Criteria should define at least these categories as guidance to editors:
** topics which on their face should be include (i.e. the notable)
** topics which are going to require some judgments to be made by editors if they are new articles or added to existing articles. (i.e. the maybe notable)
** topics which, at least according to the authors of the guideline, are ''improbably'' included. (i.e. nonnotable)
* The statement ''&quot;Decisions about including or excluding material must always reflect the opinions of outside authorities, not those of Wikipedia editors.&quot;'' is bizarre because the opinion of Wikipedia editors is what, by definition, compose the Wikipedia. ''&quot;Must always&quot;'' is a rather strange term to be found in a mere ''guideline'' at any rate. [[User:Patsw|patsw]] 13:22, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

:: If you wish to draft an alternate version, the feel free to do so ''elsewhere'' and present it to us as a possible replacement.  We are certainly amenable to productive changes.  However, IMO the current project page works and should be considered a functioning guideline. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:13, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
:I agree the ''reflect outside authorities'' wording is odd (although not any odder than &quot;notability is not subjective&quot; which expresses the [[WP:ATT|same sentiment]]). The rest doesn't strike me as an improvement. ~ [[User:Trialsanderrors|trialsanderrors]] 17:49, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

::One point that isn't being made (in the intro) and probably should be is the point that scientific theories cannot be properly presented without understanding their level of acceptance.  There's a big difference between a mainstream theory and a fringe theory, and even in an article about a fringe theory, it's important to describe it as one.  However, for some fringe theories, insufficient sources exist to back up the claim that they are fringe theories.  Thus we are left with only one real choice: disallow the article, as we cannot properly cover it while adhering to [[WP:ATT]] and [[WP:NPOV]].  This is different from, say, an article about a band, where it may be that no source reports on their popularity or number of fans accurately, but sources do report on other things: the information we can't cover can just be left out.  In articles on science, we really can't leave that out.  [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:41, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

:::The &quot;level of acceptance&quot; argument makes no sense to me. &quot;Theory&quot; in science has a very precise meaning which applies to models and descriptions which are as completely accepted as possible in an endeavor based primarily on the dubious activity of inductive reasoning. While there is a big difference between mainstream and fringe proposals, the proposals themselves are only considered &quot;theories&quot; when they pass the tests of the scientific method. What makes a proposal fringe is, ostensibly, its inability to pass these tests. This doesn't mean that scientists don't make mistakes in pejoratively labeling the fringe out of the mainstream, only to say that the level of acceptance is something of a binary operator: either it's in or it's out. When an idea does not generate enough interest in the scientific community to create commentary from members of the community, it must either be uncontroversial (as is the case with textbook knowledge) or it must be outside the scientific community. This is quite easy to verify. No amount of posturing and insisting on the part of a fringe idea's proponents that the idea is actually &quot;scientific&quot; is good enough when demarcating for our purposes. We might still have articles on the idea if there is &quot;extra-scientific&quot; interest in it, but we do not need to shy away from being honest about its &quot;extra-scientific&quot; nature. One of the problems that many pro-fringe editors have is that they believe that because [[negative proof|proving the negative]] is in principle a defiance of [[WP:ATT]] that reasonable editors can't make editorial judgments with regards to the status of a particular idea. This is simply not the case at all: we are editing an encyclopedia not compiling a list of sources. After all, that's why we have editors in the first place: we are charged with summarizing the available data in the most conformist way possible. When all the data is outside the scientific community and the idea purports to have scientific importance, it is perfectly fine to delineate the contradiction. However, this discussion is probably better suited for [[WP:FRINGE]]. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:09, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

*I think it is a little more complicated than that.
*It is not ''necessary'' to give an indication of the acceptance of a theory, in order to describe it.
*And I don't think the word &quot;theory&quot; has such a precise meaning as scientists would like. For example, Wikipedia calls the [[Big Bang]] a &quot;theory&quot;, whereas the Encyclopedia Britannic calls it a &quot;Model&quot;. And I am sure there are more sources supporting both.
*This is why the new [[WP:A]] is so important. I can attribute both the Big Bang Theory, and the Big Bang Model, but I can find no source which agues it must be one or the other.
*I can also find no attribution labelling many minority subjects as &quot;fringe&quot;, nor claiming a certain level of acceptance. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 17:47, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

== Making this an approved guideline ==

I notice that Kevin Murray has downgraded this guideline back to the &quot;proposed&quot; status.  I would revert that myself, except that I am not at all clear by what action/authority it became considered a functioning guideline.  Certainly the above poll has produced only five people who support this as a guideline.  Even without the two nay-sayers I fail to see how the five of us constitute a group that can speak for the Wikipedia community as a whole, or at least the science editors.

I for one do call for the issue of approving this as a functioning guideline be presented to the community as a whole.  [[Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)|the Village Pump policy forum]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Science|WikiProject Science]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Physics|WikiProject Physics]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Chemistry|WikiProject Chemistry]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Biology|WikiProject Biology]] are all places where this guideline can be advertised and input and approval sought.  I see little danger in this and much promise, but mostly I would like to be able to show Kevin a formal approval so that is downgrading of this guideline cannot occur again. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 02:17, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

::We don't do &quot;formal&quot; and &quot;official&quot; with respect to guidelines. What matters is if this is (1) a good idea and (2) used as such in practice.

Judged by this talk page and AFD, the answer to all three is 'yes', so this page is a de facto guideline and Kevin is the lone dissenter here. Of course, putting a notice on the village pump never hurts.

:::Kevin is not the only dissenter, I also am.  Let me enumerate some general criticisms, this time relating to the substance of the proposal.  1.  There is not a big need for this.  Most science articles up for deletion are up for other concerns than notability, primarily, concerns that the article is original research, POV, or inadequately sourced.  Although there are many debates on the test pages subpage, in very few was the critical issue the notability of the subject: [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Electric universe (concept)]], [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Socionomics]], and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Growing Earth Theory]] (and the old debates, not listed there, about [[Time Cube]]).  2.  The list of criteria, a core part of this proposal, were not used as the basis of successful arguments in any of the key examples I listed.  Rather, the test seems to be the general one of being covered in multiple independent sources, inside or outside of the scientific community.  Note that the criteria give an opportunity to supporters of OR articles (real OR, not neutral attempts at describing published research) to argue for inclusion inappropriately: see [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sorce theory]] as an example of this.  The criteria have changed since then, but the same kind of argument could be made today.  I wouldn't want to jeopardize any of those debates by having a guideline here with such minimal applicability.  3.  The list of criteria is instruction creep and isn't useful.  For articles that should be deleted, not meeting the criteria doesn't make a strong argument.  For articles that should be kept, they're okay, but arguments to delete things that meet these criteria are weak delete arguments in the first place, usually along the lines of &quot;this article is in bad shape&quot;, see [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ubiquitous computing]] for example.  The criteria seem aimed at solving a non-existant problem of the over-deletion of notable science topics.

*The fundamental flaw of [[WP:SCIENCE|Notability (science)]], is that it tries to determine only whether an article is '''scientifically''' notable. It does not consider whether an article may be notable in '''any''' other area.

*: This is a true red herring IMO.  A failure of scientific notability does not mean that an article may have notability in another manner and therefore be worthy of inclusion.  I did have wording here to that effect at one time, but it seems to have been lost.  I will see to restoring that, as I see this guideline as being usable only as a means of inclusion.  For the purposes of exclusion, the failure of a topic to merit inclusion under any guideline (including this one) is the relevant matter. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:27, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
*:  (Edit conflict) Agree with EMS; The page clearly embraces the idea that popular notability for science topics is appropriate.  Since popular notability definitely is acceptable (see the [[Time Cube]] precedent, for instance), any wording that implies otherwise should be examined.  But you aren't correctly representing the main thrust of the proposal.

::*I did not suggest that failing scientific notability means that an article MUST be notable elsewhere. I wrote that it MAY be notable elsewhere. Yet the current policy does not consider this.
::*Deleting articles based on scientific notability alone, is an incredible conceit, and should play no part of the proposed guidelines. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 17:35, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
:::*I'm not sure what your point is.  If an article is scientifically notable, fine, it's keepable.  If an article is not notable scientifically, but notable in some other way (for example, in popular culture), fine, it's keepable.  But if the article is not notable in any way at all, why should it be kept?

::::*A number of articles have already been deleted, based on whether they were scientifically notable only, or worse, ''mainstream'' scientifically notable.

:::::* So what?  I see this as something that can and should happen.  If no other grounds are being offerred to justify notability, then the article should go.  I would point out that the deleted items cited as being &quot;non-mainstream&quot; are also considered &quot;non-notable&quot;, while other items have been kept as being &quot;notable&quot; but &quot;fringe&quot;.  It seems to me that this shows that this is a reasonable and workable scheme. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 22:09, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

::::::*No other grounds for notability are offered because the articles are considered only as to whether they are scientifically notable.
::::::*For example, the article on [[Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Ralph_Juergens|Ralph Juergens was deleted]] (a) based on a Scientific notability &quot;test case&quot; (b) on the grounds that he was a &quot;non-notable non-mainstream scientist&quot;, which is accurate, but no cause for deletion by itself.
::::::*It is improper for &quot;Notability (science)&quot; to '''solely''' judge any article for deletion, as it makes no attempt to attract expert editors in other fields --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 23:12, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

:::::::* If you are saying that a deleted article had another non-scince reason for being notable, then please name it and indicate why that reason was not considered at the time.  Also do note that in such cases a request for reconsideration can be made to [[Wikipedia:Deletion review]].  However, this standard is for determining notability with respect to science, and I find it to be quite silly and disingenuous to accuse this guideline of not doing something that it is not meant to so (namely seeking non-science-related reasons for inclusion). --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 01:56, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

::::::::* Ian, I hear you.  However your objections are ''way'' off base here, because what you don't like is that a consensus of Wikipedia editors has disagreed with your stance on certain topics.  That doesn't really have any bearing on whether or not that consensus exists.  You talk like [[WP:SCIENCE]] got Ralph Juergens deleted: no.  A consensus of editors and a discussion got it deleted, and frankly, it wasn't even based on [[WP:SCIENCE]] at all, more like on [[WP:BIO]] or [[WP:PROF]].

:::::::::*No, I am criticizing the make-up of the consensus, which is predominantly science-oriented editors who decided that Ralph Juergens was not notable because he was not a mainstream scientists; That is what the summary says. The AfD was not targeted outside of Notability (Science).
:::::::::*The main reason given for deletion of &quot;Ralph Juergens&quot; was that he &quot;is only published by vanity presses&quot;; not only is this false, but it fails civility guidelines,[[WP:COI#Importance_of_civility]]. Nevertheless, this was picked up by several other editors as their reasons for supporting the AfD.
:::::::::*But this is not the place to discuss a single article, but I offer this as an example. 
:::::::::*I think it is wholly inappropriate for WP:SCI to advertise articles for deletion. WP:NOTABLE should advertise AfD, giving a editors a chance to refer to WP:SCI and OTHER notability guidelines. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 10:46, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

==One researcher POV fails NPOV==
*The third paragraph includes an incorrect statement:
:&quot;the point of view of one researcher or research term and, unless it generates a significant outside response by the scientific community or the population at large, fails NPOV&quot;
*This is a complete misunderstanding of [[WP:NPOV|NPOV]]. If we attribute a statement to a single researcher, and it conforms to [[WP:A]] and is not misrepresented, then it conforms to NPOV. The argument is whether a statement by a single researchers is ''notable'', which is completely different. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 19:26, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

::*If another attributable view is available, we describe it. If it isn't, we don't pretend there might be one. There is no double whammy.
::*Describing the POV of one person does not automatically fail NPOV, and any decent editor can describe any POV in way that fulfils NPOV.
::*Quashing a POV on the grounds that there MIGHT be a hypothetical counter-POV, fails NPOV, fails WP:A, and fails WP:V. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 00:08, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

:::::*The only requirement to provide a balanced view, is if one exists. If it doesn't, then to pretend that a view &quot;needs balancing&quot;, is presumably based on the view of an unattributable, anonymous, expert-less editor. This fails numerous Wikipedia policies.

:::::*Yet both POVs are EQUALLY valid, as long as they are not misrepresented, and can easily be described in a manner that conforms to NPOV. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 13:15, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

:::::::What you fail to realize is that there is an informal community discussion as well as a formal publication discussion. Those who are in a particular community are aware of the informal discussion and are able to tell when a topic is ignored/scoffed or when it is accepted. This cannot be reported at Wikipedia for verifiability reasons, but it still raises NPOV concerns when certain editors try to force obscure research into the forefront of an article. You are mistaking a standard of verifiability (which is the standard for how to write an article) with editorial judgement: they need not be one-in-the-same. In other words, one need not &quot;verify&quot; that there is NPOV issues because, as editors, our editorial opinions do not need to be (nor can they be) verified. The only thing that needs to be verifiable is the text of the article. We are allowed to have judgements that are external to this. As such, it is perfectly reasonable to say that there are NPOV problems with someone citing a single, isolated, though published research paper. In terms of your dark matter red herring, you have totally misconstrued the situation, and I'm fairly confident that nearly any third party not firmly ensconced in pathological skepticism toward mainstream astrophysics would find your evaluation predictably myopic. Clowe's triumphalist attitude is only justified from the standpoint of [[standing on the shoulders of giants]]. It's not like he was publishing his &quot;proof&quot; of dark matter in a vacuum -- it was a particular point that was addressed to a particular (MOND-type) objection. However, when your hypothetical John Doe bucks the established research by publishing proof against dark matter, he is publishing in a vacuum. Prof. John Doe's work is marginal and therefore marginalized by Wikipedia. Clowe's work is mainstream and therefore reported by Wikipedia. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:47, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
::::::::SA is quite right about verifiability vs. editorial judgement.  However, I have to say I worry when editorial judgement of this type comes into dispute.  Wikipedia needs sources for two reasons: one is to have attributions in the articles, but another reason is that it levels the playing field in editorial discussions.  Inherently, experts on Wikipedia are not set above ordinary editors, but they may be more familiar with the subject in question.  But experts have to prove themselves, just like anyone else.  Fundamentally, Wikipedia is a community of equal editors.  So, this is a good argument ''for'' [[WP:SCIENCE]]: in order to avoid having to rely on editorial judgement too heavily, we look for a higher standard of quality in sources for scientific topics, and where that doesn't exist, we should avoid covering the subject.

:::::::::*Let's not mix up NPOV and editorial judgment. As I said earlier, the statement in the introduction is incorrect concerning NPOV. I also said it may concern notability, so I'm not dismissing the point. But let's be accurate as editors.
:::::::::*The idea that a community has informal discussions which a particular editor may be aware, is worthless. It is not verifiable, nor attributable. 
:::::::::*I know THREE different communities, all of whom have informal discussions, and promise peer reviewed papers that I could mention too. Also worthless.
:::::::::*An encyclopedia does not run on material gleaned from Chinese whispers via anonymous, unaccountable editors.
:::::::::*I had previously brought this up at the Neutrality Project, see &quot;[[Wikipedia_talk:Neutrality_Project#NPOV_misunderstanding|NPOV misunderstanding]]&quot;. They agree. A singular POV can be described in an NPOV manner. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 16:01, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

NPOV is inherently based in editorial judgement. The only way that someone determines whether there is a problem with NPOV is by making an editorial judgement. That's why the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{POV}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag comes with the wording it does. Disputes arise between editors over NPOV: if there was a singular editor there would never be NPOV issues from the standpoint of writing an article. While I agree with Mangojuice that editors are judged external to their status as &quot;experts&quot; (see ongoing conflicts over [[WP:EXPERT]] for example), the community doesn't deny the existence of experts either. No one is saying that the encyclopedia should be &quot;run&quot; on expert judgement or the whispers of whatever anonymous and unaccountable ethnic group, but people are saying that editors may come to the table with these concerns. That's the essence of the NPOV guideline: all the points-of-view are placed on the table and the marginalization happens per the outside community and references to the outside world. No one is saying that a singular POV cannot be described, but people are saying that singular POVs present unique difficulties when writing an encyclopedia that is supposed to be NPOV. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 17:39, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

:*Indeed, all the POVs are placed on the table. And if there is just one POV (because there is one WP:V/WP:RS/WP:A), then we can still write that POV so that it conforms to NPOV, regardless of whether you or I or anyone else agrees with the POV, and regardless of whether it is mainstream of pseudoscience.
:*In which case, the statement in the third paragraph that I described above, is incorrect. A view from a single researcher may fail a criteria, but there is no reason for it to fail NPOV; and if it does, any decent editor can re-write it so that it conforms to NPOV. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 19:19, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
:::If there is only one notable POV, then sure, we write about it. In which case the statement in the third paragraph is correct. A view from a single research written about on Wikipedia does have editorial issues related to NPOV for the reasons delineated because the alternatives may exist but cannot be included without falling into original research. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 19:23, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
::::*The statement is incorrect because a single POV does not fail NPOV unless it is written badly, in which case any competent editor can correct it. Sure, the statement may be allowed because it is notable. But it won't fail because of NPOV.
::::*A single POV that has been published elsewhere does not not fail &quot;Original research&quot;, because [[WP:NOR]] &quot;refers to '''unpublished''' facts&quot;. (my emphasis) --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 19:51, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

You are missing the point. Perhaps I should post here the statement that you dispute:

:''Research published in a reputable publication passes these thresholds but reflects the point of view of one researcher or research term and, unless it generates a significant outside response by the scientific community or the population at large, focusing on such research in a Wikipedia article does not adequately conform to [[WP:NPOV|Wikipedia's policy on neutrality]], in particular the section on [[WP:NPOV#Undue weight|undue weight]].''

You'll note that the point being made is that simply quoting published work is not good enough. Why isn't it good enough? Because unless the work in question has generated discussion it has not been vetted outside of Wikipedia to make it possible to write an article on the subject that adheres to the spirit and letter of NPOV.
--[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 20:36, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
::The POV of a single researcher in a single first-rate peer-reviewed publication, has normally been assessed by 2 or usually 3 independent scientists with a tendency to be ciritical. The assumption made by colleagues it that such results are correct unless proven otherwise. Are we supposed to be more critical of physics that he physicists who review for PRL? Then, if discussed by independent sources, as most scientific papers are, it is considered worth citing and commenting one. Reputable journals expect items listed as references to be relevant to the new work also. I'm a librarian. i think many articles in most library journals are basically trivial if not junk altogether.. But they are considered valuable by my colleagues in general, and its their trms that matter. I will judge by reporting theirs',  not imposing my own.'''[[User:DGG|DGG]]''' 09:02, 9 April 2007 (UTC)

:The statement which I quoted above, is as follows:
::&quot;the point of view of one researcher or research term and, unless it generates a significant outside response by the scientific community or the population at large, fails NPOV&quot;
:A single POV may fail, or being accepted by some other criteria. But a single POV does not fail NPOV (unless an editor writes poorly). 
:*To suggest that a statement based on a single POV, changes it's NPOV standing, depending on some other ''potential'' discussion whose view is yet to be determined, is illogical. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 20:46, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

If your point is that someone can attribute a single point of view in a fashion that is NPOV, that is absolutely correct. However, not every attributable point can be written about in a neutral fashion. An example of a quote that may be non-neutral though properly attributed and sourced is given at [[WP:FRINGE#Sourcing and attribution]]. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 00:01, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

:*Since describing a single POV can be achieved in an NPOV fashion, then the description in the third paragraph is incorrect which says that a single POV without response fails NPOV.
:*Judging/assessing a single POV is another matter altogether. But just because there may be no attributable assessments, does not make the description of a single POV automatically fail NPOV. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 00:34, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

I do not agree with the demand that not only must something be said in a respected peer reviewed journal, but that we must wait for other independent researchers to chime in, in OTHER respected peer reviewed journals, and agree with the first researcher that the claim is valid. The first post would constitute a reliable source satisfying [[WP:ATT]] and would be usable in a Wikipedia article. Similarly a book from a respected publisher would constitute a reliable source, without waiting for some other authority to write another book that says &quot;I agree with the first book.&quot; The demand places the bar way too high. It may be years before someone completely independent of the first researcher publishes the demanded blessing of the first researcher's claim. [[User:Edison|Edison]] 20:20, 9 April 2007 (UTC)

==[[Schmidt Sting Pain Index]]==
Can some of you knowledgable and discerning scientist Wikipedians take a look at this please? This article has currently been getting some coverage in popular &quot;gee whiz funny link of the day... how goofy!&quot; type blogs ( I hate it when this happens and the article in question is dubious... I think it gives a bad impression of wikipedia), but it seems to be mainly based on the idea that this one insect scientist guy wrote some goofy comments for an insect sting pain index one day. Ok, I agree that insect scientists are allowed to have senses of humour (WITHIN LIMITS, for the sake of us all), but I am concerned that 1) this scale is not really widespread and may be just one scale promoted by one guy without much acceptance in the insect expert community. 2) the pdf article linked which this wikipedia entry seems to be based on does not seem to say that Schmidt actually wrote those goofy comments. Its a bit ambiguous, but its seems to say that &quot;the media&quot; (without specifying what media) came up with the goofy comments to append to Schmidt's original dry scale(I think this may be another case where people exaggerate or misinterpret what an article is saying). I dont have any access to science journal databases, and am certainly no science or insect expert. But these concerns and quick scans of google books and google scholar led me to bring this issue to wiser heads. Thanks very much  for checking this out.

The index also has been mentioned in popular science pubs; though it doesn't appear to be taken seriously by scientists.  A scientifically-based pain index would be interesting (though I decline any offers to participate in such research); both this and the related Starr index appear to be little more than the opinions of the bug guys in question.  The article certainly dances on the edge of notability.  --[[User:EngineerScotty|EngineerScotty]] 05:30, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

******Ok, once again, in case anyone can actually respond on my point: the list of criteria here seems to be a misguided attempt to define reasons for notability that no one brings up in debates.  If the issue was the over-''deletion'' of science articles, having these criteria would make sense.  But it seems to me that the main thrust of this proposal is in the opposite direction.  These are just fodder for disagreement (see [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sorce theory]] for instance) and distract from the main point about the POV and OR issues involved in using only sources from a single author.

********Good: a direct response.  Two brief points: (1) Arbcom never asked for criteria, but they did encourage developing a guideline, which is different.  (2) The EU deletion debate looks very different to me - there, the argument was done from first principles and it worked very nicely, and it skirted around the edge of these criteria (no one ever talked about whether the EU concept was &quot;textbook science&quot; or had institutional support)... and as for extended discussions with Iantresman... I don't think the criteria will make one bit of difference, and that's not a very good reason anyway.  Long-winded debate... I don't think we should seek to avoid it as a general principle, debate is a good thing.  Criteria would simplify the job but scientific topics aren't exactly overwhelming the AfD lists.

== General notability guideline template ==
Since the general notability guideline is central to most sub-pages, someone came up with the idea of creating a centralized template which will be consistent among the permutations from WP:N.  Please see whether we can make this work here.  The text is meant to be fairly generic, but it may make sense to add text following the template for fine tuning, or help us to make the template more applicable if it is not reflecting the consensus for notability.  I certainly didn't get everything that I wanted, but I'm very happy to see the compromises that make this a fairly representive of the attitude of the project.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 01:12, 7 April 2007 (UTC)

==Merging [[Wikipedia:Notability (numbers)]]==
What are the thoughts on merging [[Wikipedia:Notability (numbers)]] into this guideline proposal?  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 19:15, 25 April 2007 (UTC)

I've added a brief section which is the meat from the numbers guideline.  This seems appropriately and neatly combined here.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 16:29, 15 May 2007 (UTC)
*It's a bad idea, as explained on the talk page of WP:NUM.

== Scope creep ==

I may be beating a dead horse here, but all the references to NPOV, proponents and advocacy make it seem like this is about pseudoscience/fringe science, and the discussion above seems to confirm it. As it tries to apply to specialised but uncontroversial science, not much of it bears any resemblance to reality. --[[User:Abu-Fool Danyal ibn Amir al-Makhiri|Abu-Fool Danyal ibn Amir al-Makhiri]] 02:29, 6 June 2007 (UTC)

== Proposal concerns (LV) ==
Note that I came here from a couple of AfDs which were trying to present this as policy criteria for an article's deleltion.  As I read down the line, I encountered several problems with the proposed guideline.  I apologize if any and all of the below have been covered in the Talk Archives, which I am not going to read now.

Problems that I have at present with the proposal:

*Introduction:
:* &quot;A topic that is acceptable under this guideline is an appropriate part of Wikipedia.&quot;
::Pretty sweeping blanket statement, to me.  No other Notability criteria I'm aware of suggests that &quot;if it passes this, it's in.&quot;  Indeed, it seems to violate the principle of a Guideline to me, which always limits itself to allow potential exceptions.  Further, each section usually defines which criteria are primary and which are secondary.
*Notability of topics related to science:
:*&quot;Decisions about including or excluding material must always reflect the opinions of outside authorities, not those of Wikipedia editors.&quot;
::I know this has been mentioned above, but I want to echo this concern:  Decisions about including or excluding material must always reflect the consensus of the Wikipedia editors.  Anything else beyond that is helpful clarification, or it becomes fodder for people to [[WP:IAR]].
::I'd feel much more comfortable with something like, ''&quot;Deicions about including or excluding material on a scientific basis ought to be supported by the opinions and stated facts of outside authorities, as per [[WP:RS|Wikpedia:Reliable Sources]].&quot;''  Start throwing 'musts' around in anything but policy (perhaps only unbreakable/unmodifiable policy) and you'll get a lot of irate editors, scientific or not.
:*&quot;Although publication creates verifiability and reputable journals are reliable sources, publication by itself is not a sufficient (and sometimes not necessary) standard for encyclopedic notability. Unpublished research fails no original research and often lacks verifiability, so it is unacceptable by policy. Research published in a reputable publication passes these thresholds but reflects the point of view of one researcher or research term and, unless it generates a significant outside response by the scientific community or the population at large, focusing on such research in a Wikipedia article does not adequately conform to Wikipedia's policy on neutrality, in particular the section on undue weight. This guideline clarifies how the Wikipedia community has applied NPOV to articles on scientific topics. It does however not apply to the inclusion of scientific research as authorative sources within articles. The criterion for such sources is not that they are notable, but that they are reliable.&quot;
::Wha?  Could this be any more complex?  I actually had to diagram this paragraph out to understand it.  My hypothesis is most editors will not.  Can't you simply say it is normally necessary to follow the general notability guidelines with respect to neutral, multiple, independent, verifiabile, reliable sources?  And if you do that, what is the point of this whole section - I'm seriously not understanding how this adds anything to present guidelines.
* Criteria / General
:*&quot;1. Widely cited. Papers covering the topic have been widely1 commented on in academic writing within the topic's field.
::2. Outside notability. The topic is notable due to significant coverage in reliable sources outside of academic publications.&quot;  
::So we want articles only commented upon widely by multiple academic sources, which also are commented on outside academic sources?  Seems pretty wide, to me.
::Aside from that, I know I read somewhere that Wikipedia is not just a general encyclopedia, but can cover articles appropriate to special subject encyclopedias as well.  Thus 2. might well fail, as most specialist encyclopedias I am aware of have many articles which would only be known inside the discipline the encyclopedia represents.
:*&quot;Notable topics which are primarily non-scientific... [etc.]&quot;
::Boy, I'm going to love the AfDs which try to define whether a topic is &quot;science&quot; or not trying to use this.  Not to mention the arguments you'll get whether or not cosmology (for example) has a scientific basis or not.  Not to mention you're setting up a criteria which is so subjective it will rarely-if-ever be able to objectively define where this guideline would be relevant or not.
::Also, you will get editors asking whether the guideline itself applies or not - something I don't think I've ever seen with any of the other specialty N's about the guideline ''itself''.  I don't need to know if Burpa-Cola has been covered in the Cola News and CNN, or if Billy Bob Arthbutnott has both parlimentary opinions as well as the Sun documenting his career to know that Corp or People:Politicians applies.
*Scientific terms
:Again, how does this get beyond neologisms in a way that Avoid Neologisms doesn't, aside from adding the words &quot;scientific literature&quot;?
*Numbers and Sources
:*&quot;1. Have professional mathematicians published papers on this topic?
::2. Is the sequence listed in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences? (In the case of sequences of rational numbers, does the OEIS have the sequences of numerators and denominators of the relevant fractions?)
::3. Do MathWorld and PlanetMath have articles on this topic?&quot;
:::This may be taken from WProj numbers, I don't know.  But are you stipulating that 2 and 3 are reliable sources? (The Sources section has exactly this same problem.  You're controlling what is considered a Reliable Source without allowing the Wikipedia community at large to define that.  I have a problem with that - if I were arguing Notability(Religion), I would not want it to say that the Bible is an authorized source and any other 'holy' texts by default would have to prove themselves.)
*Sources
:*&quot;Scientific discovery is often disconnected from public discourse, so standard methods of sourcing and verifying are not always applicable. A scientific topic which yields low hit counts in the Google test...&quot;
::That's nice.  The Google test is widely regarded as discredited anyway.  Yes, I know it's still used, but it's questionability is known.
::Also, verifying and sourcing is verfying and sourcing.  I believe what's being aimed at here is scientific notability may have a smaller and different base (with different types of sourcing) for inclusion than other forms of notability.  So why not say that?  Except that above you're demanding 'popular' coverage as well as academic.
:*&quot;Web (and library) searches should therefore be evaluated based on the quality rather than the quantity of the finds.&quot;
::Thus, you allow extreme subjectivity creep, unless you are going to make further instruction creep in what constitutes scientific quality.  (My Jung is better than your Freud.  My Hawking beats your Einstein.  My t test is better than your bean counting.)  Common sense might be able to dictate that, but science is full of periods of flying in the face of qualitative common sense and succeeding - because it's right.
:*&quot;The following is a list of sources with qualifications of their usefulness.&quot;
::Again, you're preaching what is and isn't acceptable as a source, without allowing the community consensus to decide this over time. 
:*&quot;Google, Yahoo.... [etc]&quot; 
::Uh, again, how is this any different from Google test?

Finally, may I invite you to consider that most notability guidelines are much less complex and much more tolerant of letting individual cases be decided as individual cases?  And I hope that the question about &quot;Have we reached consensus?&quot; is asking if you as the editors have reached consensus about what you want to present to the community as a whole, as opposed to &quot;Are we ready to make this policy ourselves?&quot;

It may seem like I'm pissing all over your proposal.  I hope it doesn't, because I'd like to see a Notability(Science) guideline.  But I want it to be one that's usable and used - I wouldn't do either with this, and I'd argue as need be when someone tries to use this as a vote justification (which will happen, whether you want it to or not.)  Sorry for the length of the diatribe.

The rejected tag is appropriate and should stand until there is adequate discussion here to demonstrate active interest in the proposal.

It looks like a number of the contributors here are no longer active at WP: Lantreman ws banned, BDJ and Science Appologist have quit, Minder Binder, Abu-Fool Danyal ibn Amir al-Makhiri, and Laughing Vulcan have not contributed substantially since June and at all since mid-July.   &lt;s&gt;Trials and Errors and Radiant are advocating reinstating this as a proposal&lt;/s&gt;, but I don't think that there are enough editors who see this as a need.

* What I see now is something that is so watered down and nebulous that it cannot act as a genuine policy.  If people want to revive this effort, then we need to return to a version like [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Notability_%28science%29&amp;oldid=117329647 this one] and work from there.  IMO, what happenned to this effort is that a number of people whose pet articles were running afoul of this proposed policy chose to get involved with the blatant intent to sabotage it and remove its impact on their work, and unfortunately succeeded in doing so.&lt;br&gt;IMO, there is a genuine need for a policy like this to clarify what &quot;notability&quot; and &quot;verifiability&quot; mean in the context of a science article, and how [[WP:UNDUE]] should be applied.  It may be that this is an issue that is best handled by the admins with the advice and consent of the community so that we can avoid the pitfalls of the past. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:49, 20 August 2007 (UTC)
*I see, if not frequent, so at least [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere/Wikipedia:Notability_%28science%29&amp;limit=500&amp;from=0 recurrent use] of this guideline/proposed guideline/essay, very much in keeping with the rather low number of science-related AfD discussions. Absence of discussion on the talk page certainly doesn't establish rejection. I agree with EMS that the two-item version is watered down beyond recognition of the original version, and I don't see any consensus for it. ~ [[User:Trialsanderrors|trialsanderrors]] 16:07, 20 August 2007 (UTC)
:: Per [[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines]]: ''&quot;A rejected page is any proposal for which consensus support is not present, regardless of whether there is active discussion or not. Consensus need not be fully opposed; if consensus is neutral on the issue and unlikely to improve, the proposal is likewise rejected. It is considered bad form to hide this fact, e.g. by removing the tag. Making small changes will not change this fact, nor will repetitive arguments. Generally it is wiser to rewrite a rejected proposal from scratch and start in a different direction.&quot;'' --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 16:14, 20 August 2007 (UTC)

::: It seems to me that a lot of work has gone into turning this into something that everyone can reject.

== Reverted to earlier version ==

I have reverted the article to the form of lat March, with some twaking of the lead and the first section.  The revised first section now has a simple first paragraph that states the need to this policy as succinctly as I can.  The next two paragraphs have had their order exchanged so that the farily dry &quot;relevance&quot; paragraph comes last.  The previous last paragraph has been removed as an unreadable mess.  (I believe I drafted that paragraph originally, but it really never worked as intended, and only got worse over time.)

The {{tl|rejected}} tag has been kept as a matter of form, with the {{tl|proposed}} tag just commented out but still present.  I for one would be happy to see this version go back to &quot;proposed&quot; status, but I want to see if others are on-board for doing that.  Let's just say that after having taken a rest, I am ready and willing to work towards acceptance of a functional version of this as a policy or guideline if others are. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 18:24, 20 August 2007 (UTC)

:Personally, I don't see a lot of point reviving this.  The criteria have always been an attempt to change practice rather than an attempt to document practice, and to most people, the criteria and the proposal are one and the same.  The criteria really haven't caught on, and from my experience, people rely on other policies for scientific topics, like [[WP:OR]] and [[WP:V]], and where notability is needed, the general [[WP:N]] seems to be sufficient and its use is accepted.

:: Having looked more closely at the edit history, I find that your attempt to streamline this two two items has met fairly stiff resistance.  Then again, that is little wonder since your proposed consolidation ends up being little more than a restatement of pre-existing policy.  The goal of this proposal is to set up guidelines that go beyond the current policies and which are adapted to the issues which are unique to science.  Wikiepdia has very much outgrown [[WP:NOR|&quot;No original research&quot;]] and the requirement to use [[peer review]]ed [[scientific journal|journals]].  What do you do with a source that is &quot;peer reviewed&quot; but where the peers are fellow followers of a [[fringe science|fringe theory]]?  What do you do about the use of [[Nature (journal)|Nature magazine]], which is highly respected but does not use peer review to help select its articles?  What do you make of a theory published in a respected scientific journals but on which noone has cared to comment except the author?  What do you do with the [[cold fusion]] controversy created by Pons and Fleishman back in 1987 which obviously is notable within science but which was never respected by it?  There will not be many of these to contend with, but when they do appear this guideline will be invaluable.
:::::Please excuse my comment here, but the article content of Nature is peer reviewed. Like some other journals, it has on rare occasions published things based on consensus of the key editors, without formal peer review. The news content is not, of course, just editorially prepared -- by the most careful people around. It was they who caught the similarity of the stem cell photos after the peer reviewers missed it.

:: You like to cite [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sorce theory]] as a place where this guideline did not work.  For that I solidly disagree.  That article's creator had to play all kinds of games with these criteria to make a case for keeping the article.  In the end, his attempts to make the article look acceptable only helped to do it in.  In context this is a farly powerful tool.  In addition, it is not going to do in fringe science articles.  For example, I helped by have an aritcle on a book by [[Halton Arp]] kept because it was noted within the field of astronomy and also gained some measure of attention from the public at large.  That press coverage (both scientific and popular) could establish notability as described here was helpful in that discussion. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 01:03, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

:::You might note that my reduction to two criteria stood for over two months without comment.  You may also note that coverage by press and by scientific sources were the criteria I left in place, since those are the only part of the criteria that are useful.  What I object to are the other criteria, like &quot;textbook science&quot; or &quot;popular belief&quot; that are redundant and provide loopholes for argumentative POV pushers.  Can you hypothesize an example where a topic is &quot;textbook science&quot; or has a &quot;prominent advocate&quot; or has &quot;institutional support&quot; where the topic would be acceptable for Wikipedia ''without'' significant coverage in independent, reliable sources, academic or otherwise?

::::I am not sure whether I agree with you or not. I certainly think that there are science articles that are best referenced by standard textbooks, particularly for articles that are at the level of high school or early university science. For example, we probably do not want to source a peer reviewed journal on [[density]] and we do not. Are textbooks reliable sources? If so we do not need to mention &quot;textbook science&quot;, but if they are not, we probable do. --[[User:Bduke|Bduke]] 03:09, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

::::::: As for the other criteria: you agree on 3 and 4.  6 is totally pointless, because none of the criteria would expire once met.  7 obviously must require sourcing to back it up or it's totally vacuous and anyone could claim it about anything.  And anything discussed in a legitimate textbook is already covered in a reliable source, and I highly doubt that we'd ever find a case where one textbook mentions a topic but absolutely no other sources do.  Yeah, I agree, if we pare it any further, the ''criteria'' say nothing more than [[WP:N]] does.. so maybe we should lose the criteria altogether, or just spend more time explaining the issues that arise in assessing the quality of sources, especially academic ones.

(unindent) I think that you have just made an excellent suggestions in calling for an explanation of how to assess the reliability and relevance of sources.  Given some of the issues I have had recently with the anti-relativists over at [[talk:Herbert Dingle]], this makes a lot of sense.  (In those discussions, at least one person would take anything that he could find from a &quot;peer reviewed journal&quot; as evidence of a conflict over relativity and the [[twin paradox]].  Said contributions come from almost unknown overseas journals and in another case a blatantly anti-relativity publisher.)  I would still keep the remaining criteria as a way of saying that those things are the primary hallmarks of scientific notability, while noting that other options for notability are not prohibited. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:20, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

:I believe that's better, but I still think we should remove the criteria.  The problem is, people always seem to conflate a notability guideline and its criteria, while all other text is ignored.  By not having criteria, we would force people to read the discussion about the reliability of scientific sources.  (Actually, come to think about it, &quot;Notability (science)&quot; may not be the best name.  What about &quot;Reliable sources (scientific)&quot;?)

:: The criteria don't exist for the benefit of those that would abuse them but instead for the benefit of those that are looking for good guidance on what is acceptable.  The creator of an article will invariably try to defend it against an AfD.  IMO, if the article's creator can make a case that their article is acceptable under this criteria and everyone agrees, then these criteria have done a service in helping people to make that decision.  Similarly, if people listen to the creator's case and conclude that it does not hold water, then the criteria will also have helped by focussing the debate on the relevant issues and helping to bring about the deletion.  So as I see it these criteria overall are helpful.  Besides, it really is in the absense of clear guidelines that you get the nastiest debates. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 19:01, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

(a) Notability, (b) reliability of a source, and (b) reliable of the facts in that source, are all quite different, and tell us how to describe information, not whether to include it. If Arp publishes some information in an obscure overseas publications, and Stephen Hawkins in in Nature, Arp's supporters will find his article more notable, and no less reliable. And if Hawkins is described in a textbook, then it tells us that his ideas have a wider readership, and neither are as popular as today's astrology column.  &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment was added by [[Special:Contributions/{{{IP|{{{User|84.244.165.174}}}}}}|{{{IP|{{{User|84.244.165.174}}}}}}]] ([[User talk:{{{IP|{{{User|84.244.165.174}}}}}}|talk]]) {{{Time|17:34, August 21, 2007 (UTC)}}}&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Abandon this as an unnecessary complication==

Whether a peer review journal, a textbook, a popular book, a university hosted website or a notable persons personal site  is sufficiently reliable, reputable, or secondary is probably best treated on a case by case basis, and in any case this is not a problem specific to science.

Are there any controversial articles that are better treated by Notability (science) than by WP:NOR, WPV, and WP:N?  I think not.  I think there are too many guidelines, especially where they overlap.  True science should only need to satisfy WP:NOR and WP:V.  Where the subject is not true science, or is borderline, a further test should be simply whether others have written about it.  WP:N provides this test.  A lot of work has been invested in this project page, but that is not sufficient reason to adopt it.  It is rule creep, and it does damage by obfuscating more important policies and guidelines.

There seems to be tendency here for some to want a guideline to provide a science-quality test.  This is not an encyclopaedia’s role.  The ascribing of “Finge science”, “pseudo science” or “lunacy” to any theory is a job for third party sources, not for wikipedia rules.  

EMS suggests that some nasty debates exist because of the weakness of this guideline.  Some elaboration would be nice.  Discussion above suggests to me that the relativity article needs work, not that wikipedia needs more rules.

This project page should be abandoned.  Science is well covered by WP:OR and WP:V, and where notability is needed, the general WP:N seems to be sufficient and its use is accepted. --[[User:SmokeyJoe|SmokeyJoe]] 02:08, 22 August 2007 (UTC)

It’s always about sourcing, specifically whether the sources are sufficiently independent, sufficiently secondary, sufficiently reputable (not a blog or similar), or covers the subject in sufficient depth.  These are all straight WP:N issues, deriving directly from a combination of WP:NOR and WP:V.  There is plenty of evidence of spirited debate in places about the science of the content involved, and this sometimes is uncivil, but such spirited debate seems to me to be irrelevant to the debates, and always a symptom of editors who are too far into OR editing and are not looking at the subject objectively.  This is why Notability (science) may do more harm than good.  It suggests that there is something special about science.  The criteria for inclusion in wikipedia do not depend upon the science.

==physics? i think not==
do not confuse the observer effect with the uncertainty principle. the uncertainty principle has nothing to do with &quot;observing&quot;, it has to do with measuring. the observer effect is a supposed effect of observing an event and the influence of your presence on the event. no one would ever have to actually observe a particle's position to obfuscate its momentum, the mere act of using the photons to measure its position, even if nobody ever observed it, would suffice.

-------------
don't you have to observe in order to measure?
-------------

Indeed.  But what does measuring have to do with Quantum Mechanics exactly?  

To measure is to observe the results of a measurement process [that ascertains the subject measurement].  Humans observe with their senses — the senses that humans have.  Other conscious beings, perhaps including computers, may have other senses with which they can implement tools for making measurements.  At the end of the day, measuring ''ALWAYS'' involves observing.  

Tools used by beings to make measurements are limited (in their accuracy) by various factors including the limitations of ones senses.  The often-mentioned example of bouncing a photon off of an atom to measure its position illustrates the problem with knowing the position ''AND'' momentum of ''THAT'' atom at the ''SAME MOMENT'' in time.  The concept usually centers on the fact that the position measurement photon will change the momentum of the subject atom.  But aren't there other aspects of this problem?  

In the limit (considering the non-zero mass of the atom and the non-zero energy of the photon), can one ever know perfectly even the position alone?  Perhaps so, since the mechanical inertance of the atom precludes its reaction at ''THAT'' infinitesimal instant in time.  

Why is not ''THIS'' example an instance of &quot;observer effect&quot; rather than the uncertainty principle, per se?  If one seeks only to measure the position alone, then maybe it is neither.  Then again, is it not &quot;Observer Effect&quot; even if the momentum is changed by measuring only the position?  One would think so.  

Well, what if we start with measuring the momentum &quot;first&quot;?  How does one measure momentum, anyway?  Again, we observers devise a measurement process that allows our senses to detect the &quot;answer.&quot;  Momentum is mass times velocity.  If we know the mass, we might then seek to measure the velocity.  Human observers tend to ascertain velocity by measuring position at two points in time.  For non-zero velocities, this means two different points in space, of course.  Yet, [instantaneous] velocity is ''DEFINED'' at only one point in space and time.  Thus, one cannot measure velocity (or momentum) in this manner: one must ''WAIT'' to ''SEE'' how fast it is moving, and this yields only an average (not instantaneous) value.  

Before continuing on to propose measuring momentum, per se, by some other means (say, smashing the atom into an obstacle at a known position), we should note that the Uncertainty Principle pertains only to Quantum Mechanics.  In ''THAT'' world, particles are not particles; rather, they are probability density functions.  The interpretation of this ''MODEL'' of a particle says the position and momentum of the subject particle are INHERENTLY uncertain by virtue of the mathematical model itself.  To precisely derive the position, one must manipulate the model in a manner that causes the momentum &quot;to drop out of the formula,&quot; and vice versa.  

The relationship between position and momentum described by Quantum Mechanics is somewhat like the relationship between the time domain and the frequency domain described by the Fourier Transform.  One can say that there is some similarity as well between position and velocity in Classical Mechanics.  In fact, the description above with knowing the velocity versus position of the atom is exactly that: Classical Mechanics. 

Following this line of thinking, one (''such as this user who is not fluent in the intricate semantics of Quantum Theory'') might be likely to reach these conclusions: 
 

'''1. Using &quot;particulate&quot; atoms and photons to describe the Uncertainty Principle of Quantum Mechanics is ''flat wrong''.''' 

'''2. One does not observe Quantum Mechanics.  Rather, one uses that theory to make calculations to explain the observations of certain experiments.'''

'''3. Measurements ''ALWAYS'' involve observations and therefore also ''ALWAYS'' involve the Observer Effect.  Perhaps this ''IS'' the “Theory of the Observer Effect.”'''

'''4. The Uncertainty Principle of Quantum Mechanics and the Observer Effect are ''fundamentally'' unrelated.'''  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:JimRodgers|JimRodgers]] ([[User talk:JimRodgers|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/JimRodgers|contribs]]) 12:54, 31 July 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

For some reason this article is more focused on what the observer effect is not. --[[User:Nathanael Bar-Aur L.|Nathanael Bar-Aur L.]] 20:09, 10 April 2007 (UTC)

From what I understood from other sources, the observer effect is basically the collapsing of a quantum system's wavefunction that happens the moment a measurement in made upon it (by an &quot;observer&quot;), therefore cancelling any superposition that may have existed beforehand, and giving specific definition to the renderings. Is this correct? --[[User:Nathanael Bar-Aur L.|Nathanael Bar-Aur L.]] 20:21, 10 April 2007 (UTC)

==Suggestions==
Current article states &quot;not that of the driveshaft, along the axis of the car&quot;.
Add a paragraph that illustrates this with the driveshaft of the front-engine, rear-wheel-drive Porsche 928.
Also industrial examples and diagrams from mechanical engineering and classical mechanics.
e.g. a torque tube to allign parts of a hinge operated by two hydraulic cylinders.&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/206.188.57.60|206.188.57.60]] ([[User talk:206.188.57.60|talk]]) 14:42, 30 October 2006 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;

== Diagrams ==
Can anyone find a picture of this? I'm having a very hard time picturing what this would look like...[[User:70.157.134.125|70.157.134.125]] 01:01, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

==Accuracy==
This page is not really accurate. Cars like the STS, Corvette, etc. have independent rear suspensions, and the torque tube is not used to transmit acceleration forces in these vehicles. Rather, it is because they have trans-axles in the rear of the car and it connects the trans-axle with the engine in the front. However, I am not enough of an expert on the subject to write a clear and well-written clarification so I have just added some templates to the top of the page. --[[User:Ozziegt|Ozziegt]] ([[User talk:Ozziegt|talk]]) 21:33, 1 July 2009 (UTC)

:Corvette since at least 1988 doesn't have a torque tube (unless they put one in later), and apart from the Miata I'm hard pushed to think of an IRS that uses one. I agree, this article is pretty horrid, it needs a rewrite rather than refs. [[User:Greglocock|Greglocock]] ([[User talk:Greglocock|talk]]) 11:13, 2 July 2009 (UTC)

:Corvettes since the late 90's do indeed have torque tubes, of the same type that the Porsche 924/944/928 etc use.  All the mentioned Porsches are IRS and use a torque tube.  Part of the probem with this article is that it lumps very diverse systems together;  the early Ford systems are completely different from the Corvette/Porsche systems.  Both are classified as torque tubes, but the article does not focus on the essence of a TT, which is the use of a smaller torque-transmitting element inside a carrier. The carrier may or may not be static and may or may not be carrying driveline forces (like the Fords). [[User:52FordF-1|52FordF-1]] ([[User talk:52FordF-1|talk]]) 15:44, 18 July 2009 (UTC)

::Yup my bad, 2005 Corvette (as a random example) uses a transaxle and a torque tube. Note that the Corvette system is different to the Peugoet one, as the latter includes an articulating joint at the front whereas the Corvette system does not. This is a big deal, to a driveline engineer at least.[[User:Greglocock|Greglocock]] ([[User talk:Greglocock|talk]]) 23:25, 18 July 2009 (UTC)

:Agreed. The article as written is essentially BS. A torque tube fundamentally counteracts the torque of the driveshaft; the alternative is that the torque is counteracted by the torsional rigidity of the frame (the net torque must, obviously, be zero otherwise the rear of the car would rotate). The torque tube often does transfer forward wheel force to the front of the car, but this is not inherent in the mere fact of having a torque tube: there must still be a mechanism locating the wheels longitudinally relative to the diff/transaxle. This is analogous to the usual need to locate the wheels relative to the frame (most simply, with leaf springs) in order to move the car forward.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/110.175.57.184|110.175.57.184]] ([[User talk:110.175.57.184|talk]]) 05:05, 18 March 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== simple definition? ==

It has been my understanding from looking through service manuals and talking to mechanics that the corvette style torque tubes are just an enclosed driveshaft that connects a front mounted engine to the rear mounted transmission (with fully independent rear suspension)

I guess it's not simply called a 'driveshaft' in a classical sense since it doesn't connect a front mounted transmission to the rear differential  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/184.57.87.173|184.57.87.173]] ([[User talk:184.57.87.173|talk]]) 20:38, 15 August 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</text>

'''''Hello!'''''

Thanks for uploading some pictures to Wikipedia.  I wanted to make sure you were aware of some of the requirements and good practices for uploaded images.

*'''Pick an image name.'''
:When [[Special:Upload|uploading]] an image, pick a file name that is descriptive, and unique.  Remember that many images may be uploaded about the same topic, and remember that names are case sensitive.

*'''Source the image.'''
:On the [[Help:Image page|image description page]], explain where the image came from.  If you created the image yourself, then say so.  If it's from the web, give a URL.  If it's a screenshot of a movie or game, or a scan from a book, give the title.

*'''Provide copyright and license information.'''
:This part is a little bit trickier, but it's very important.  The copyright of the image generally belongs to whomever created it.
::''If it's a photograph you took, or an image you created'' (modifying an image that already exists doesn't count) in software like [[Photoshop]] or [[GIMP]], then you own the copyright.  To upload it to Wikipedia, you must agree to license it under the [[GFDL]] (which allows anyone to use it, but requires that they give credit to the original author and requires that any further edit to the image be licensed under the GFDL as well) or release it into the [[public domain]] (which allows anyone to use it for any purpose without restriction.)  Do this by placing an appropriate [[WP:ICT|tag]] on the [[Wikipedia:image description page|image description page]], like &amp;#123;{[[Template:GFDL|GFDL]]}} or &amp;#123;{[[Template:PD|PD]]}}.  Be sure to mention that you created the image.  If you're using &amp;#123;{[[Template:PD|PD]]}}, you may also want to use &amp;#123;{[[Template:NoRightsReserved|NoRightsReserved]]}}, since there is some dispute as to whether one may grant items into the public domain.
::''If you didn't create the image,'' or the copyright somehow belongs to another party (like a screenshot, which you might &quot;create&quot;, but the copyright belongs to the author of the movie or video game), then you need to find another [[WP:ICT|tag]] that describes the copyright status of the image.  Images used on Wikipedia need to be free for our use and the use of [[WP:FORKS|sites]] which reproduce our content.  This means that images cannot have a restriction such as &quot;only for use by Wikipedia&quot;, or &quot;for non-commercial use only&quot;, or &quot;for educational use&quot;.  Images without a free license may be usable in certain articles under [[WP:FU|fair use]], but such a use should be justified on the image description page.

*'''Describe the image.'''
:To another reader, the image may not be immediately understood.  A caption in an article doesn't explain the image to a visitor who sees it on its image page.  Put a brief explanation of what is in the image on the image description page, similar to what you might include in a caption on an article.  

Some links to Wikipedia pages on this subject: 

'''[[Wikipedia:Copyrights#Image guidelines|Copyrights]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags|Copyright tags]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Fair use|Fair use]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Image description page|Image description page]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Granting work into the public domain|Public domain]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion|Images for deletion]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Possibly unfree images|Possibly unfree images]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Copyright problems|Copyright problems]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Uploading images|Uploading images]]'''

Thanks again for your contributions.  If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me at my talk page. [[User:Feydey|feydey]] 19:42, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

An '''anti-submarine missile'''  is a [[standoff missile|standoff]] [[anti-submarine weapon]]. Often a variant of [[anti-ship missile]] designs an anti-submarine systems typically use a [[jet engine|jet]] or [[rocket engine|rocket]] engine, to deliver: an [[explosive material|explosive]] [[warhead]] aimed directly at a [[submarine]]; a [[depth charge]], or;  a homing [[torpedo]] that is carried from a launch ship, or other  platform, to the vicinity of a target.
[[File:Ikara missile.JPG|thumb|right|&lt;small&gt;[[Ikara (missile)|Ikara]], an [[Australia]]n-designed missile used by several navies between the 1960s and 1990s; a [[rocket engine|rocket]]-parachute delivery system carried an [[acoustic torpedo]] up to 10 nautical miles (19 km) after launch. A variant re-designed in the UK and used by the Royal Navy could deliver a [[Nuclear depth bomb|nuclear depth charge]].&lt;/small&gt;]]
[[File:Maille-Braize-14.jpg|thumb|&lt;small&gt;The [[Malafon]], used by the French Navy between 1966 and 1997, used a rocket-assisted glider to carry a torpedo up to 8 nautical miles (13 km) after launch&lt;/small&gt;. ]]

==History==
[[Depth charge]]s were the earliest weapons designed for use by ships against submerged [[submarine]]s. These explosives were initially dropped as the ship moved over the presumed location of a submarine. Before World War II, shipboard [[sonar]] was unable to maintain contact with a submarine at close range. 

Various [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]]-type projectors, including [[hedgehog (weapon)|hedgehog]] and [[squid (weapon)|squid]], were devised during [[World War II]] to allow a ship to maintain sonar contact while lobbing explosive charges toward the submarine.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Terry, and Costello, John ''The Battle of the Atlantic'' (1977) Dial Press {{Listed Invalid ISBN|0-8037-6454-2}} pp.307-308&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the [[Cold War]], [[missile]]s were developed to provide greater range with reduced [[recoil]]. Some missiles and rockets carry [[homing torpedo]]es to provide terminal guidance for the warhead.&lt;ref&gt;Albrecht, Gerhard ''Weyer's Warships of the World'' (1969) United States Naval Institute p.385&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''northern river shark''' or '''New Guinea river shark''' (''Glyphis garricki'') is a [[species]] of [[requiem shark]], in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Requiem shark|Carcharhinidae]] found in scattered [[tidal river]]s and associated coastal waters in northern [[Australia]] and in [[Papua New Guinea]]. This species inhabits areas with poor visibility, soft bottoms, and large [[tide]]s, with immature sharks ranging into [[freshwater|fresh]] and [[brackish water]]. It is similar to other river sharks in having a stocky grey body with a high back, tiny eyes, and broad fins. It measures up to {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} long.

Northern river sharks are likely [[piscivorous]]. This species is [[viviparous]], with females bearing litters of 9 young possibly every other year before the [[wet season]]. Very rare and facing threats from [[commercial fishing|commercial]] and [[recreational fishing]], and perhaps also [[habitat degradation]], this species has been assessed as [[Critically Endangered]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]].

==Taxonomy==
The first known specimens of the northern river shark, two newborn males from Papua New Guinea, were discovered by [[New Zealand]] [[ichthyologist]] [[Jack Garrick]], after whom the species was eventually  named. This shark was referred to as &quot;''Glyphis'' sp. C&quot; until 2008, when it was formally described by [[Leonard Compagno]], William White, and [[Peter R. Last]] in a [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] paper. The [[type specimen]] is a female {{convert|67|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, collected from the [[East Alligator River]], [[Kakadu National Park]], [[Northern Territory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Compagno, L.J.V. |author2=W.T.

==Distribution and habitat==
The northern river shark has been reported from [[King Sound]], the [[Ord River]], and Doctors Creek near [[Derby, Western Australia]], the [[Adelaide River|Adelaide]] and [[Alligator Rivers]] in Australia's [[Northern Territory]], and the [[Daru]] region and possibly the [[Fly River]] in Papua New Guinea. It inhabits large [[river]]s, [[estuaries]], and coastal [[bay]]s, all of which are characterized by high [[turbidity]], silty or muddy bottoms, and large tides. Young and juvenile sharks are found in fresh, brackish, and salt water ([[salinity]] ranging from 2 to 36 ppt), whereas adults have only been found in marine environments.&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pillans et al&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pillans, R.D. |author2=J.D.

==Description==
Like other members of its genus, the northern river shark has a stocky body with a high back. The head is wide and flattened, with a broadly rounded snout and minute eyes equipped with [[nictitating membrane]]s. Each [[nostril]] is divided into a very large incurrent opening and a small excurrent opening by a triangular skin flap. The sizable mouth is broadly arched, with short furrows at the corners. Thirty-one to 34 tooth rows are in the upper jaw and 30&amp;ndash;35 tooth rows are in the lower jaw; the upper teeth are upright and triangular with serrated edges, while the lower teeth are narrower and straight to slightly curved. In the largest individuals, the first few lower teeth from the jaw median are spear-shaped with serrations near the tip.&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;/&gt;

The [[pectoral fin]]s are large and broad, with gently backward-curving margins and pointed tips. The [[pelvic fin]]s are triangular with nearly straight trailing margins. The first [[dorsal fin]] is long-based and triangular, with the apex almost forming a right angle; the second dorsal fin is some two-thirds as high as the first. The origin of the first dorsal fin lies over the pectoral fin insertions, while that of second dorsal fin lies over the pelvic fin rear tips. No ridge exists between the dorsal fins. The [[anal fin]] is smaller than the second dorsal fin and has a strong notch in the rear margin. The [[caudal fin]] has a strong lower lobe and a long, narrow upper lobe with a ventral notch near the tip. The [[dermal denticle]]s are small, oval, and overlapping, bearing three horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth. This shark is steel-gray above and white below; the color transition is sharp, located well below the eye, and becomes jagged on the sides of the trunk. The anal and caudal fins become dusky or black towards the trailing margins and tips. The maximum known length is {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}}. This species differs from the [[speartooth shark]] (''G. glyphis'') in several [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] and [[meristic]] characters, including having fewer [[vertebra]]e (137&amp;ndash;151 versus 213&amp;ndash;222) and a lower, jagged gray-white color boundary.&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;/&gt;

==Biology and ecology==
With its slender teeth, small eyes, and high density of [[ampullae of Lorenzini]], the northern river shark seems to be [[adaptation|adapted]] for hunting [[fish]] in conditions of poor visibility. In Doctors Creek, sharks may move to and from favored feeding areas with the tide.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thorburn, D.C., D.L. Morgan, A.J. Rowland and H.S. Gill. (February 2004). [http://www.environment.gov.au/coasts/publications/pubs/glyphis-wa.pdf The northern river shark (''Glyphis'' sp. C) in Western Australia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108234623/http://environment.gov.au/coasts/publications/pubs/glyphis-wa.pdf |date=8 November 2011 }}. Report to the National Heritage Trust, Murdoch University. Retrieved on 10 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Like other requiem sharks, this species is [[viviparous]], with the developing [[embryo]]s forming a [[placenta]]l connection to their mother after exhausting their supply of [[yolk]]. Females give birth around October, before the start of the [[wet season]], on possibly a biennial cycle. One female examined contained nine [[fetus]]es.&lt;ref name=&quot;pillans et al&quot;/&gt; The young are born at under {{convert|67|cm|in|abbr=on}} long; males [[sexual maturity|mature]] between lengths of {{convert|1.2|and|1.4|m|ft|abbr=on}}, while females mature between lengths of {{convert|1.4|and|1.7|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;/&gt;

==Human interactions==
The northern river shark appears to be extremely rare, though more subpopulations may remain to be discovered in Australia and Papua New Guinea. Based on present information, no more than 250 mature individuals are estimated to exist in the wild, with no more than 50 in any particular subpopulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt; This species is caught legally and illegally by [[commercial fisheries]] using [[longline fishing|longlines]] and [[gillnet]]s, as well as by [[recreational fishing|recreational fishers]]; [[habitat degradation]] may pose a further threat to its survival. Because of its low natural abundance, limited distribution, stringent habitat requirements, and susceptibility to various human-caused threats, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] has assessed the northern river shark as [[critically endangered]]. It has also been listed as endangered on the 1999 Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, and on the 2000 Territory Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act. Kakadu National Park may be an important protected area for this species.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt; No regulations restrict the capture of this species in Papua New Guinea.&lt;ref name=&quot;white et al&quot;/&gt;

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Zoidberg. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Zoidberg~enwiki that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]]. If you think you might own all of the accounts with this name and this message is in error, please visit [[Special:MergeAccount]] to check and attach all of your accounts to prevent them from being renamed.

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== Hare Krishna picture ==

There is a picture of a Hare Krishna procession in the [[Religion_in_Mexico#Buddhism|Buddhism]] section, even with a caption about them being buddhists. Hare Krishnas are not buddhists, they are hindus. The article is semi-protected so I can not correct that myself. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Wenzelkarbovski|Wenzelkarbovski]] ([[User talk:Wenzelkarbovski|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Wenzelkarbovski|contribs]]) 17:39, 22 April 2015 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Self-ascription fallacy ==

''The last census reported, by self-ascription, that over 95% of the population is Christian.''

The so-called self-ascription of the census is nothing but a silly way of measuring data. Obviously they count children as Christians just because their parents say so. This people should either be clear about this or not count children at all. By the way, since a couple of years ago the Catholic Church has started to indoctrinate [[Huichol]] kids. Shame on us, Mexicans. Shame on us... The Huichols were one of the very few indigenous people whose religious tradition haven't been polluted by Catholicism but now the church has started taking advantage of the poverty of this people and the new constitutional reforms to infiltrate to their villages and improvise &quot;schools&quot;. Of course they know that adults wouldn't let themselves be indoctrinated so they choose to attack young minds. Catholicism and ignorance have been the ingredients of our condition as a Third World country.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Scandza|Scandza]] ([[User talk:Scandza|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Scandza|contribs]]) 13:27, 30 May 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;


Can anyone explain why the Evangelical Free Church of America does so many, many missionary trips to Mexico, when it's a predominantly catholic country? I mean, there are definite ideological differences involved, but I wasn't aware the two churches actively tried to convert each other's members.


==First phrase==

Any interest in removing &quot;Unlike some other Latin American countries&quot; from the first sentence of the article? It does not seem to serve any objective purpose and seems slightly antagonistic.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Namenderkrieg|Namenderkrieg]] ([[User talk:Namenderkrieg|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Namenderkrieg|contribs]]) 15:34, 24 March 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Easter==

I'm removing this:

&quot;Some of them however, do not celebrate Easter because they think that the Easter Bunny is the devil. Instead of celebrating Easter, they like to eat Mexican Pizzas.&quot;

because it's obviously untrue and just stupid. I think the article should be rewritten though, by someone more experienced than I am.--[[User:PARCGOP|PARCGOP]] 14:09, 7 April 2007 (UTC)

==Contradiction?==
This article says that 95% of people in Mexico are Roman Catholic.  The Mexico article states that 95% of people are Christian, and only 89% are Roman Catholic.  Which is correct, or am I just confused?
[[User:Yumecosmos|Yumecosmos]] ([[User talk:Yumecosmos|talk]]) 02:20, 9 January 2008 (UTC)

== Rewriting ==

I have imported the Religion section from the article on [[Mexico]] and integrated the information that was only on this article. I also moved around paragraphs and added a subtitle to make reading easier. Finally I removed the stub templates and replaced it with the expand one. --[[User:Marianika|Marianika]] ([[User talk:Marianika|talk]]) 16:32, 19 May 2008 (UTC)

== What about non-believers? ==

What about atheists, agnostics, deists in Mexico? How many Mexicans actually believe in God? Is there any data about that?  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/213.196.243.113|213.196.243.113]] ([[User talk:213.196.243.113|talk]]) 22:41, 27 May 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Mexican Ethnic Religion (Mexicayotl) ==

This article lacks a part about the growing movement of Mexicayotl, or Ethnic Mexican Culture or Religion, which is the revival of &quot;Aztec&quot; religion. --[[Special:Contributions/79.45.49.143|79.45.49.143]] ([[User talk:79.45.49.143|talk]]) 12:47, 16 August 2010 (UTC)

== Typo in Nonreligious section ==

'''John Ralph Ragazzini''' (January 3, 1912&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pnxBAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=John+Ralph+Ragazzini+1912&amp;dq=John+Ralph+Ragazzini+1912&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjC4sew9dPVAhXMHJoKHeWmAFsQ6AEIKzAB Profile of John Ralph Ragazzini]&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; November 22, 1988) was an [[United States|American]] [[electrical engineer]] and a professor of [[Electrical Engineering]]. 

==Biography==
Ragazzini was born in [[Manhattan, New York City]] and received the degrees of B.S. and E.E. at the [[City College of New York]] in 1932 and 1933 and earned the degrees of A.M. and Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at [[Columbia University]] in 1939 and 1941.

Ragazzini was dean of the School of Engineering and Science at [[New York University]] and during [[World War II]] he was chairman of the Department of Electrical Engineering at Columbia University, where he was involved in the [[Manhattan Project]].

Ragazzini's notable students are [[Rudolf E. Kálmán]] (see [[Kalman filter]]s), [[Eliahu Ibraham Jury]] (see [[Z-transform]]), [[Gene F. Franklin]] (see [[digital control]]), and [[Lotfi Asker Zadeh]] (see [[Fuzzy sets]] and [[Fuzzy logic]]).

Ragazzini is also credited, along with Lotfi Zadeh, in 1952, to have pioneered the development of the [[z-transform]] method in [[discrete-time]] [[signal processing]] and analysis.

In 1970 he received the [[Rufus Oldenburger Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asme.org/about-asme/honors-awards/achievement-awards/rufus-oldenburger-medal |title=Rufus Oldenburger Medal |publisher=[[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] |accessdate={{Format date|2013|2|14}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, [[American Automatic Control Council]] named [[John R. Ragazzini Award]] after Ragazzini and he was the first recipient of the award. Ragazzini died on 22 November 1988, aged 76.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/24/obituaries/john-ragazzini-76-educator-and-engineer.html&lt;/ref&gt;

I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under [[Wikipedia:Fair use|fair use]] but there is no [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline|explanation or rationale]] as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags/Fair use|boilerplate fair use template]], you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with [[WP:FU|fair use]].

Please go to [[:Image:Brokeninpieces.jpg|the image description page]] and edit it to include a [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline |fair use rationale]]. Using one of the templates at [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline]] is an easy way to insure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template. Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.

If there is other other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on the other images used on this page.

The '''United Church, Chapel on the Hill''' in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]] was the city's main church during [[World War II]]. Dedicated on September 30, 1943 and completed late in October 1943, it was originally a multi-denominational [[chapel]] shared by [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and [[Judaism|Jewish]] congregations.&lt;ref name=NationalRegister/&gt;&lt;ref name=churchhistory&gt;[http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=category&amp;sectionid=4&amp;id=39&amp;Itemid=55 Church History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728092956/http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=category&amp;sectionid=4&amp;id=39&amp;Itemid=55 |date=July 28, 2011 }}, United Church, Chapel on the Hill website, accessed March 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architectural design ==
The building design is a [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] 700-series [[U.S. Army]] chapel.&lt;ref name=Townsite&gt;[http://oakridgevisitor.com/history/pdf/OriginalTownSites.pdf Chapel on the Hill] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517124718/http://oakridgevisitor.com/history/pdf/OriginalTownSites.pdf |date=May 17, 2008 }} in ''Jackson Square – the original Townsite'', Oak Ridge Convention and Visitors' Bureau&lt;/ref&gt; It is a frame building built on a three-bay rectangular plan with a [[Steeple (architecture)|steeple]]d [[bell tower]] and a [[gable]] entry [[porch]]. It was one of three Army chapels built using the same design in Oak Ridge during World War II. One of the other two chapels, the West Chapel in the city's West Village area, was later torn down, but the East Chapel in the East Village is still in use.&lt;ref name=NationalRegister&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfo.doe.gov/me70/history/NPSweb/Oak_Ridge_Historic_District_(Preferred).pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form for Oak Ridge Historic District |date=July 18, 1991 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829041710/http://www.cfo.doe.gov/me70/history/NPSweb/Oak_Ridge_Historic_District_%28Preferred%29.pdf |archivedate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The U.S. Army built the chapel to house religious activities, as one of numerous community facilities in the &quot;townsite&quot; area of Oak Ridge. The building was dedicated on September 30, 1943, in a ceremony that included [[prayer]]s and talks by a Jewish [[rabbi]], a [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|Catholic priest]], an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] priest, a [[Baptist]] minister, and the [[minister (Christianity)|minister]] who was serving the United Church congregation that eventually came to own the chapel.&lt;ref&gt;Charles W. Johnson and Charles O. Jackson (1981), ''City Behind a Fence: Oak Ridge, Tennessee, 1942-1946''. The University of Tennessee Press. Pages 127-129.&lt;/ref&gt; Its name, &quot;The Chapel on the Hill,&quot; comes from a reference in a prayer by the Knoxville Baptist minister who participated in the dedication.&lt;ref name=Townsite/&gt;

The United Church congregation that is housed in the Chapel on the Hill traces its history to July 18, 1943, when some 25 to 30 Christians of diverse denominational backgrounds gathered for Sunday worship in Oak Ridge's main [[cafeteria]]. Subsequently, several members of the group made plans to establish an interdenominational Protestant church, led by [[laity|layperson]]s, to include all denominations. A [[Presbyterian]] minister working in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] was engaged to conduct weekly services, and about 150 people representing 13 Protestant denominations became charter members of &quot;the United Church&quot;. Governing boards of laypersons elected to lead the new congregation took up their duties on October 24, 1943.&lt;ref name=pre1980&gt;[http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=51&amp;Itemid=55 Pre-1980 Historical Compilation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728093006/http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=51&amp;Itemid=55 |date=July 28, 2011 }}, United Church, Chapel on the Hill website, accessed March 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Chapel-on-the-Hill was completed that same month, the United Church and the local Roman Catholic Church were given control of the building, as the only two churches then officially operating in the [[Manhattan Project]] community. During the war, when Oak Ridge's Manhattan Project facilities were operating around the clock, the chapel building was also in use nearly 24 hours a day as a venue for worship services, [[wedding]]s, and other occasions for local workers of various Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish religious backgrounds.&lt;ref name=pre1980/&gt;

At the peak of wartime activity in Oak Ridge, when the population exceeded 70,000, the United Church employed four ministers and conducted worship services in the Chapel on the Hill, East Village Chapel, and the Jefferson Theater, as well as [[Sunday school]] classes in several local schools and a [[mobile home|trailer]] camp. By 1951, the United Church Chapel-on-the-Hill consolidated as a single [[interdenominational]] congregation, making its home in the Chapel on the Hill building.&lt;ref name=pre1980/&gt;

The United Church congregation purchased the chapel and {{convert|3.72|acre|ha}} of land from the [[U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]] on May 11, 1955 for a price of $17,116.&lt;ref name=pre1980/&gt; An adjoining educational building was added in 1956-1957.

It is felt that the article you created at [[Ethan cavett]] is not suitable for a Wikipedia article, which must have a [[Wikipedia:Notability|notable]] subject and be [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verifiable]]. I have moved it to [[User:{{PAGENAME}}]], which is where users are free to write about themselves. You are at liberty to move it back into the (Main) namespace but bear in mind that if you do so, it is likely to be nominated for deletion. 

Note, however, that the purpose of a user page is to enable active editors of Wikipedia to introduce themselves to other editors. [[WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_a_blog.2C_webspace_provider.2C_or_social_networking_site|Wikipedia is not a general hosting service]], so your user page is not a personal homepage. Content unrelated to Wikipedia or its editing is likely to be removed.

Please see [[WP:User_page|the user page guidelines]], especially [[WP:User_page#What_can_I_not_have_on_my_user_page.3F|this section]] for more information. -- [[User:Omicronpersei8|Omicronpersei8]] ([[User talk:Omicronpersei8|talk]]) 19:36, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

'''Archer''' is a [[slab serif]] typeface designed in 2001 by [[Tobias Frere-Jones]] and [[Jonathan Hoefler]] for use in ''[[Martha Stewart Living]]'' magazine. It was later released by [[Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones]] for commercial licensing.

==Structure==

The typeface is a [[Slab_serif#Geometric_model|geometric]] slab serif, one with a geometric design similar to sans-serif fonts. It takes inspiration from mid-twentieth century designs such as [[Rockwell (typeface)|Rockwell]].

The face is unique for combining the geometric structure of twentieth-century European slab-serifs but imbuing the face with a domestic, less strident tone of voice. [[Ball terminal|Balls]] were added to the upper terminals on letters such as ''C'' and ''G'' to increase its charm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Devroye|first1=Luc|title=Jonathan Hoefler|url=http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-27370.html|publisher=McGill University|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Italic type|Italics]] are true italic designs, with flourishes influenced by calligraphy, an unusual feature for geometric slab serif designs. As with many [[Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones]] designs, it was released in a wide range of weights from hairline to bold, reflecting its design goal as a typeface for complex magazines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Typographica review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Earls|first1=David John|title=Archer|url=http://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/archer/|website=Typographica|accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
The typeface has been used for, among other things, branding for [[Wells Fargo]] and is a main font for the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' and [[Wes Anderson]]'s film ''[[The Grand Budapest Hotel]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=Lauren|title=Is Archer's Use on Target?|url=http://www.aiga.org/is-archers-use-on-target/|publisher=AIGI}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the current font used for titles and body text by the [[Design Observer]] website.

===[[Katisha]]===
Contains no information not in [[The Mikado]] article, the point of the spin-off unclear, as the character only appears in one opera, and it's unclear how this could expand further. In normal circumstances I'd say merge or make it a redirect, but, as I said, everything IS covered in [[The Mikado]], and I can't imagine someone searching for &quot;Katisha&quot;.

*'''Delete''' article per nomination.  Anything notable about this character should appear in the plot summary of ''[[The Mikado]]''.  There is no reason to have a separate article for this character.  -- [[User:Ssilvers|Ssilvers]] 19:59, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Redirect''' it to [[The Mikado]] -- merge isn't needed since the info's there, but the redirect could be useful -- somebody could search for it. -- [[User:ArglebargleIV|ArglebargleIV]] 22:15, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

A tag has been placed on [[:Nonamaker]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article seems to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable [[Wikipedia:Notability|(see the guidelines for notability here)]]. If you can indicate why the subject of this article is notable, you may contest the tagging. To do this, please affix the template &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; to the page and leave a note on [[Talk:Nonamaker|the article's talk page]] explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself.

Please read the [[WP:CSD|criteria for speedy deletion]] (specifically, article #7) and [[Wikipedia:Notability (people)|our general biography criteria]].

== Waterboarding ==

Could you post a link where somebody calls [[surfing]] [[waterboarding]]?  I can't seem to find any. [[User:Jehochman|Jehochman]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Jehochman|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:46, 26 April 2009 (UTC)

Yes, Waterboarding is a very common term in Hawaii, the Western US, Australia and even some former Soviet countries. Here's a link to an article where the author references this http://mydailyclarity.com/2009/03/surfing-for-peace-in-the-gaza/. Also, I found a site that references waterboarding here http://www.hawaiiansouthshore.com/shop/product.php?productid=17375. It get's confusing; I was looking for 'surfing' but we call it Waterboarding so I got to the wrong page ;-)

: Fair enough.  That source uses &quot;water boarding&quot; with a space.  I've made a change to your edit to reflect the space. [[User:Jehochman|Jehochman]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Jehochman|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:23, 26 April 2009 (UTC)</text>

I removed &quot;2006 is only his second full season as a team-manager. It took other team managers, such as [[Frank Williams]] many years to win a grand prix as manager.&quot;

This suggests Fry is responsible for a dramatic turnaround in the team's performance - their 2005 and 2006 performances have been widely acknowledged to have been poor to middling. the circumstances of the Hungarian GP were also exceptional. [[User:Mark83|Mark83]] 19:37, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

::It has been reported in the Telegraph (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/motorsport/formulaone/5369856/Monaco-Grand-Prix-Jenson-Buttons-playboy-days-behind-him.html) that Nick Fry owns a proportion of the team, and in an earlier article, that he owns the majority stake. Shouldn't this be added?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/92.239.225.23|92.239.225.23]] ([[User talk:92.239.225.23|talk]]) 23:17, 28 May 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Klein-Glienicke Schweizerhaus 1.jpg|thumb|320px|''Schweizerhaus'' in [[Klein Glienicke]] near [[Berlin]], designed by [[Ferdinand von Arnim]], 1867]]
'''Swiss chalet style''' ({{lang-de|Schweizerstil}}, {{lang-no|Sveitserstil}}) is an [[architectural style]] of [[Historicism (art)|Late Historicism]], originally inspired by rural [[chalet]]s in [[Switzerland]] and the [[Alps|Alpine]] (mountainous) regions of [[Central Europe]]. The style refers to traditional building designs characterised by widely projecting roofs and facades richly decorated with wooden balconies and carved ornaments. It spread over [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Austria-Hungary]] and [[Scandinavia]] during the ''[[Belle Époque]]'' era.

==History==
[[File:Villa Fridheim, Krøderen, 2.jpg|thumb|Villa Fridheim in [[Krødsherad]], Norway]]
Swiss chalet style originated in the [[German Romanticism|Romantic]] era of the late-18th/early-19th century, when the ideas of the [[English landscape garden]] inspired parks and residences in Germany, such as the [[Dessau-Wörlitz Garden Realm]]. It became highly appreciated on the continent by noble landowners who were impressed by the &quot;simple life&quot; of people living in the mountains. 

The chalet style soon spread over the German ''[[Mittelgebirge]]'' landscapes such as the [[Harz]] mountains or the [[Dresden]] area and the adjacent [[North Bohemia]]n region. As a &quot;modern&quot; building style, it also influenced the [[resort architecture]] along the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] seaside, like in [[Binz]] or [[Heringsdorf, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|Heringsdorf]]. Around 1900, design elements were used in the construction of numerous bourgeois family homes as well as by notable architects like [[Heinrich von Ferstel]] to build larger mansions and hotels. 

The style was further popularized by the first waves of tourism of rich people from the North and West of Europe and became popular in other parts of Europe and North America, notably in the [[architecture of Norway]], [[architecture of Iceland|Iceland]] and [[Architecture of the Netherlands|the Netherlands]] and in the [[country house]] architecture of [[architecture of Sweden|Sweden]] and [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati (Ohio, USA)]], in the late 19th and early 20th century. English examples of the chalet style include the [[Boathouse at Belton House]], [[Lincolnshire]], by [[Anthony Salvin]] and the Swiss Cottage at [[Osbourne House]], on the [[Isle of Wight]], constructed for [[Queen Victoria]]'s children.

==Characteristics==
The style is characterized by:
*[[Gabled roof|Gabled roofs]] with wide [[eaves]]
*Exposed construction beams, including large [[Bracket (architecture)|brackets]]
*Decorative carving and mouldings
*[[Balconies]]
*Large windows
*[[Weatherboarding]], usually painted, often in bright colors

The result was '''delete'''. -- [[User:Jitse Niesen|Jitse Niesen]] ([[User talk:Jitse Niesen|talk]]) 12:28, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

:In case anybody requires an explanation how I arrived at this decision, as it is a bit borderline: There seems to be only one reliable source, an article repeated in USA Today and other media. What tipped the balance is firstly the weak reasons in some of the &quot;keep&quot; comments (specifically, those of necronudist, Portillo, and I don't understand Minfo); and secondly, I think we should be extremely cautious in having articles about living children. -- [[User:Jitse Niesen|Jitse Niesen]] ([[User talk:Jitse Niesen|talk]]) 12:45, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

* '''Delete''' - he's ten years old, for crying out loud. If he makes it as a pro then add him in but not until then. [[User:Qwghlm|Qwghlm]] 20:09, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
**'''Comment''' You can't delete or not delete an article purely based on age. --[[User:Pinkkeith|Pinkkeith]] 20:11, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
***'''Comment''' - the point is that he doesn't meet [[WP:BIO]]. There are thousands of kids with potential; they get articles here when that potential is realised by playing for the first team of a significant club. WP is not a crystal ball. [[User:BlueValour|BlueValour]] 20:53, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
****'''Comment''' Well, that wasn't the point that you made, but it does pass [[WP:BIO]] based on [[WP:GOOGLE]]. There is no crystal ball to this article at all, it is all based on present information and known fact. --[[User:Pinkkeith|Pinkkeith]] 21:00, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
*****'''Comment''' What &quot;known fact?&quot;  There is not a single source cited in the entire article.  I am particularly leery of this becoming another AFD where the article is kept because of references cited in the AFD discussion that never make it into the article thus defeating the entire purpose of this discussion and [[WP:V]].  --[[User:ElKevbo|ElKevbo]] 14:26, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
*We can, however, '''delete''' an article if no reliable sources are provided when challenged under [[WP:V|verifiability policy]].  Pinkkeith, can you point us to featured coverage in mainstream media?  Some of those are needed to let us keep the article.  Being signed to a youth team isn't notable enough to get thousands of other kids their own WP articles.  [[User:Barno|Barno]] 20:39, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
** Here is a [http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/technology/maney/2005-02-01-maney_x.htm USA Today article] on him. In there the writer mentions that he was covered in numerous other newspapers. --[[User:Pinkkeith|Pinkkeith]] 20:43, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
*** - fine but he has achieved nothing in the adult world - the press references are the result of a splendid publicity campaign for his video but that doesn't confer notability. [[User:BlueValour|BlueValour]] 20:57, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
**** That's blatent [[ephebiphobia]]. Reread the article, the entire article is talking about the video and how it made him notable. --[[User:Pinkkeith|Pinkkeith]] 21:01, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

[http://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=%22Jean+Carlos+Chera%22&amp;btnG=Search+Archives&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8 Google News Archive] search yields 74 unique hits- more than enough to qualify as &quot;the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person.&quot; How old the subject is and the method in which he was made notable isn't relevant; the subject meets [[WP:BIO]]. --[[User talk:Rory096|Rory096]] 21:14, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
:*'''Comment''' - most of the content, apart from his birthdate, fails [[WP:V]]. The Ghits mean we can keep the article not that we must. They are all the result of a single video being published on the internet and they have all picked up the same story.

[[User:BlueValour|BlueValour]] 16:58, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''-So he's a child prodigy, that doesn't make him notable.  Some of my friends are amazing at basketball, but they don't have any articles.  As above, if he makes it to the pros (or college, if Brazil has a college league, I dunno), then we can always repost.

*'''Delete'''  When he has played for Manchester United, Arsenal, Porto, Eindhoven or Real Madrid he will have earned his article.  Until then it is worth remembering that, at least in the UK, it would be highly improper for professional clubs to express an interest in a 10 year old, let alone to 'openly court' them.

*'''Delete''' I've reviewed some of these news articles. I can read only the English ones, which are basically the same novelty one-shot story, repeated, or something like the USA today story, which is more about how everyone is famous on the Internet than a biographical source for an article.

Many of the users are very bias against the idea of a 7yr old having its own article or the fact that his only a child prodigy, but indeed we have a child prodigy article. Im definately getting a sense of outright bias and a feeling that many of the voters here are americans. [[portillo]]

*'''Comment''' - I think most of the delete (and some of the keep) votes are completely missing the point. Of course this kid isn't a notable footballer. He is however notable as an internet/media phenomenon. Wikipedia has plenty of articles for such people, as an example go look at [[Mahir Çağrı]]. Then at the bottom of his page have a look at the categories he's placed in. When someone comes to Wikipedia and searches for &quot;that kid i saw clips of on TV&quot; or &quot;that kid my mate sent me videos of&quot; and who's name give 35,000 google hits... He should be here! [[User:Alii h|aLii]] 15:20, 6 November 2006 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' per norm. [[User:Minfo|м info]] 23:03, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - I wonder if there is a misunderstanding here? If you are a child prodigy as a piano player you can play the piano. If you are a child prodigy as a mathematician you can do complicated sums in your head. Here, the kid undoubtedly has unusual ball skills but that doesn't make him a footballer. I also don't see him as a 'internet/media phenomenon' with any longevity - with YouTube such phenonima come and go like snow in the sun. [[User:TerriersFan|TerriersFan]] 00:01, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
:He was born as a YouTube phenomen but now he's known by all of the users above, has google entries and BBC articles. Guys, you wanna delete him, let's do it. Simply there are people who search for him and people who know him, there are many articles on paper magazines about him, but if you are too zealous to keep a 9-years-old top-youngster 'cause &quot;well, dear Watson, it fails WP:BIO =_= ahem&quot; let's do it. Do it and stop arguing bullshits. --[[User:Necronudist|necronudist]] 09:24, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

The '''European Federation of [[Financial Analyst]]s Societies''' ('''EFFAS''')[http://www.effas.com] is the federation of [[financial analyst|analysts]] associations in Europe. EFFAS comprises 27 member societies representing more than 14,000 investment professionals. EFFAS was founded in 1962 and the headquarters is located in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]].

Besides its European training programme CEFA (Certified European Financial Analyst) EFFAS also grants the Certified International Investment Analysts (CIIA) designation, ensuring professional qualification by offering global as well as local market knowledge within its examination structure. As a global designation the exams can be taken in different languages. Through the national member societies EFFAS provides a full range of services for capital market experts.

==CIIA Certification==
EFFAS participates in further developing the [[Certified International Investment Analyst]] (CIIA) examinations, a financial analyst designation recognised globally. Analysts who belong to European analyst associations that are members of EFFAS, are eligible to participate in the final CIIA examination, if they pass the foundation and the national exams, or if they hold the Certified European Financial Analyst diploma (CEFA).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Big Andy, (Andrew Walsh) was born in Louisville, Ky., on Feb. 12, 1978.  His father, Frank Walsh and mother, Marsha Sils were overly delighted to have him, since their first son, Patrick, was a dud.  Big Andy was known through his childhood as being pretty funny.  His brother, not so much.  His parents divorced in 1981, after his father recuperated from emergency brain surgery, after falling through the roof at his work and landing head first on the concrete below.  He continued to work there until he passed away after a 3 year battle with melanoma, in 2006, a week before his 54th birthday.  His mom remarried and had another child, a daughter named Brittani (Gamble).</text>

{{Wikipedia subcat guideline|notability criteria|{{PAGENAME}}|[[WP:NMS]]&lt;br&gt;[[WP:SCIENCE]]}}
--&gt;
{{rejected}}

Ideas related to science are an important part of any comprehensive [[WP:ENC|encyclopedia]].  This guideline and its criteria are intended for use in determining whether a topic is notable due to being a part of or related to science.  The tests in this guideline are intended to be fairly rigirous so that a topic that is acceptable under this guideline can be considered an appropriate part of Wikipedia.  However, the failure of a topic to meet this guideline's criteria does not automatically exclude it, as it may attain notability through [[WP:N]] itself or another of its subsidiary guidelines.

==Notability of topics related to science==

The need for this guideline comes from there being a set of topics which do not fail the test of the [[Wikipedia:No original research|No original research]] policy or the [[Wikipedia:Attribution]] policy but which none the less are not appropriate to Wikipedia because they do have sufficient notability.  Such topics mostly represent new findings and theories, as well as past findings and theories that have failed to gain significant attention in either scientific circles or the public at large (or so far failed to gain said attention).

A key element to understanding this guideline is that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a research publication, and as such Wikipedia does not usurp the usual validation processes of scientific institutions such as [[peer review]], [[scientific consensus]], and academic recognition. Decisions about including or excluding material must always reflect the opinions of outside authorities, not those of Wikipedia editors. Inclusion or exclusion is therefore not a judgement on the validity, importance or accuracy of a scientific contribution, but simply a reflection of the quality and quantity of responses it received inside and outside the [[scientific community]].

This [[WP:N|notability guideline]] derives its relevance from the policies [[WP:NOT|What Wikipedia is not]] (in particular [[WP:NOT#IINFO|Not an indiscriminate collection of information]] and [[WP:NOT#CRYSTALBALL|Not a crystal ball]]), [[WP:NOR|No original research]] and [[WP:NPOV|Neutral point of view]] (in particular [[WP:NPOV#Undue weight|Undue weight]] and [[Wikipedia:Neutral point  of view/FAQ#Pseudoscience|Pseudoscience]]), as well as the guidelines [[Wikipedia:Conflict of interest|Conflict of interest]] and [[WP:AUTO|Autobiography]]. Also of importance are [[WP:V|verifiability]] and [[WP:RS|reliability]] policies.

==Criteria==
=== General ===
In general, a contribution in the field of science is notable enough to merit inclusion in Wikipedia if it meets at least one of the following criteria:

#'''Textbook science.''' There is regular non-incidental mention of the contribution in general or specialized textbooks published by reputable presses.{{ref|1|1}}
#'''Widely cited.''' Papers covering the contribution have been widely cited{{ref|2|2}} in its research field{{ref|3|3}} relative to other papers in the same area. Self-citations, and citations in journals which are not respected within the relevant research field should be excluded.
#'''Press and fiction.''' It is or was well known due to extensive press coverage, or due to being a recurrent theme in notable works of [[fiction]]. In this case the article should make note of this status. A single article on the theory, even if from a major media source such as ''[[New Scientist]]'' or ''[[Scientific American]]'', is not a sufficient criterion.
#'''Historical interest.''' It has historically met any of the above criteria within the scientific community or the culture at large but has since either been [[superseded scientific theory|superseded]], disregarded, or dismissed by the scientific community or the culture at large. The article should make note of the subject's status in this regard.
#'''Popular belief.''' It is or was believed to be true by a significant part of the general population, even if rejected by scientific authorities.

Notable topics which are primarily non-scientific in nature but which contain claims concerning scientific phenomena, should not be handled as scientific.  For example, the ''[[Book of Genesis]]'' itself is primarily covered as a religious scripture rather than as a cosmology. On the other hand, subjects such as [[creationism]] or [[creation science]], which involve a direct conflict between scientific and religious doctrine, are properly evaluated both on a scientific and theological basis. Similarly, subjects purporting to have a scientific basis may be noteworthy primarily on cultural or sociological bases, such as UFOs, which can usefully be discussed from several different perspectives.

:{{Seealso|Wikipedia:Notability (science)/Irrelevant arguments}}

===Scientific terms===
:''See also [[Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms]]
A scientific term is considered notable and worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia if the following can be established:
# A commonly agreed-upon formal or informal definition
# A trajectory of use for the term in the scientific literature from [[WP:RS|reliable]] and [[WP:V|verifiable]] sources
To determine notability it is important to keep in mind that different fields sometimes use the same term to describe different concepts. On the other hand, especially in the early stages of a field, terminology is often not standardized and different terms are used for the same concept. The policy on [[WP:NAME|naming conventions]] gives more information on the choice of the proper term when more than one term is used in the scientific literature.

== Assessing the reliability and relevance of sources ==

Journals from which citations and evidence of notability are obtained are expected to be well known and respected within the relevant research field.  The previous requirement of citation from a peer-reviewed source is not alone sufficient by this requirement.  (Peer review is done just as easily by a fringe science journal as by a leading journal, while [[Nature (journal)|Nature magazine]], one of the most respected [[scientific journals]] in existence, uses editorial as well as  peer review for submissions.)

Textbooks should either be well-known and respected or produced by a reputable scientific publisher (which is most likely the same publisher as one or more respected journals).

Journals from scientific societies of developing countries are occasionally not reliable.  If a finding in such a journal should prove to be of great scientific interest, that finding is often reprinted and/or reported in reliable scientific sources.  In such a case, the original journal article can be cited as a primary source, but its relevance should be backed up by secondary citations in known reliable sources.

For biographical articles and articles on fringe science, there is some loosening of these requirements.  Works by the topic of a biographical article are relevant to the article whether their writing was published in a reliable journal/publisher or not.  Also, the contents of a journal devoted to a fringe science can provide evidence as to the past or current thinking within that fringe field.  However, the fringe science journals cannot provide evidence for the outright notability of the topic.

==Notes==
{{note|1|Note 1}}:  The scientific contribution must have a major entry in the work. A passing mention of the concept is not sufficient. 

{{note|2|Note 2}}:  Citation counts and peer review mechanisms differ vastly between sciences, fields, and subfields, and editors are urged to inform the relevant [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Council/Directory/Science|WikiProject]] about ongoing debates to get expert input. It should also be noted that ''quantity'' of citations is often only a poor approximation of ''quality''.

{{note|3|Note 3}}:  A &quot;research field&quot; indicates an established area of study for which the topic in question is only a part.  A topic cannot be its own research field, nor can it gain notability from being part of a field which is non-notable.

__NOTOC__
===Overview===
After much deliberation of the [[Wikipedia:Danny's contest/Contest entries|contest entries]] the judges have arrived at a decision.

The entries could be broken down into three broad groups... entries that didn't seem to have much, if any, improvement, entries that were a &quot;good try&quot; and a handful of entries that really took the contest to heart and added a lot of interesting and germane references.

===Criteria===
The judges graded on 4 major criteria:
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!Criterion
!Description
!Weight
|-
|'''Number of citations'''
|Just a  raw count of how many were added. This was a good filter to see if the article could make the finalists... only 2 or 3 refs suggested that maybe not so much had been done.  
|(20%)
|-
|'''Complexity of citations'''
|A gauge of the difficulty level of adding them. Were they notes? web cites? book cites? did they use ISBN tagging? were there multiple places that got the same note? Notes ON notes? 
|(30%)
|-
|'''Appropriateness of cites'''
|Were they actually GOOD cites that moved the article forward?
|(20%)  
|-
|'''Overall article improvement'''

|'''[[Battle of Ceresole]]'''
|An important battle in medieval history, part of the [[Italian Wars]] series. Characterised by contemporaries as &quot;marvellously confused&quot; this battle is attractively illustrated with lots of maps and diagrams. One would expect Kyrill as coordinator of [[WP:MILHIST]] to do a good job of improving an article, and Kyrill does not disappoint. A very powerful article about an interesting battle.

|'''[[Theramenes]]'''
|An important general and historical figure of ancient Greece, including participating in an Athenian coup, multiple battles, and a rebellion. He even had notoriety after death. The article is challenging due to a paucity of sources, but Robth found 80+ cites. There also is an innovative organisation of sources into modern and ancient. A very good article based on some painstaking research.

|'''[[Crawford expedition]]'''
|A very understudied but important battle in the [[American Revolution]]. The winning side often tends to ignore battles they lost, and this article was not much more than a single paragraph stub when Kevin went to town on it. It is now profusely illustrated with maps, paintings, tables and diagrams and has grown to 43 Kb. In addition to 88 high quality footnotes, it also has a comprehensive &quot;references&quot; and &quot;for further reading&quot; section, properly separated out. All books have good ISBN links. This article is a real tour de force and shows the power of our encyclopedia well.

That all of these articles were somehow military related was surely coincidence! :)

'''Joe Eubanks''' (born 1975) is an [[United States|American]] [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] best known by the [[ring name]] '''Lobo'''. He wrestled primarily in [[Combat Zone Wrestling]] (CZW), where he won every major championship and was the first inductee into the [[CZW Hall of Fame]] in 2004. He was formerly the CZW Commissioner/Talent Coordinator.&lt;ref name=&quot;Online World of Wrestling&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/040207.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling 5th Anniversary Show February 7, 2004 - Philadelphia, Pennsylvania - ECW Arena|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===1999-2002===
Along with [[Nick Gage]], [[Justice Pain]], and [[Ric Blade]], Lobo was trained by [[John Zandig]] at the CZW Wrestling School and graduated first in the class.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freewebs.com/andy_czw1/history.html CZWHookup : The history of CZW] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210134119/http://www.freewebs.com/andy_czw1/history.html |date=2008-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He became one of the main wrestlers in CZW along with other graduates from the school. In February 1999, Lobo became the second [[CZW Iron Man Championship|Iron Man Champion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Online World of Wrestling&quot;/&gt; He held the title until June when he lost it to Justice Pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/990619.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling - CZW Down in Flames June 19, 1999 - Mantua, NJ |accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two continued wrestling each other and competed in the first ever Cage of Death match at the first ''Cage of Death'' show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/991016.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling - CZW Cage of Death October 16, 1999 - Mantua, NJ|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lobo won the match and regained the title. He would lose this title to [[Matt Prince|Wifebeater]], but regain it one more time the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/000311.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling - CZW March Violence March 11, 2000 - Sewell, NJ|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lobo also challenged for the [[CZW World Heavyweight Championship|CZW Heavyweight Championship]]. He feuded with Zandig for the title and finally beat him in July 2000. He held the title until ''Cage of Death II''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/000909.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling - CZW Cage of Death II....After Dark September 9, 2000 - Sewell, NJ|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that show, Lobo successfully defended the championship against Zandig in the Cage of Death match. Directly following this match, Justice Pain came out and fought Lobo in another Cage of Death match. In the match, Lobo was thrown from the top of the cage to the ground through a table covered in barbed wire. Justice Pain went on to win the match and the title.&lt;ref name=&quot;Online World of Wrestling&quot;/&gt;  After losing the title, Lobo continued feuding with Zandig. This time, the feud was for ownership of CZW. On February 9, 2002, Lobo defeated Zandig to become the new owner of CZW. He held this position until ''Cage of Death IV'' when Zandig defeated him to regain his position as CZW's owner &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/021213.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling December 13, 2002 - Philadelphia, PA - Viking Hall|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2003-present===
He took some time off from CZW following the Cage of Death match. While he was gone, a new group called the Hi-V tried to take over CZW, with Zandig as their main target. Zandig was planning to face the Hi-V at ''Cage of Death V'', but the stable outnumbered his team 6 to 4. At ''Night of Infamy II'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/031115.html|title=Night of Infamy II - November 15, 2003 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lobo made a shocking return to help Zandig and join his team just in time for Cage of Death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/031213.html|title=Cage of Death V December 13, 2003 - Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their team was successful. In February 2004, Lobo became the first inductee to the CZW Hall of Fame. After this, Lobo remained inactive for the following two years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Online World of Wrestling&quot;/&gt;

At [[Cage of Death 7]], [[Zandig]], who had turned on the fans, wanted to run CZW the way they used to. He called out Lobo, who was backstage for the event, and they joined each other along with [[Justice Pain]] and [[Nick Gage]]. They would later call themselves the Forefathers of CZW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/_2006/|title=2006 results

*'''Speedy Delete''' - for blatant advertising.  I waited a bit to see how this one would play out before making a decision, but as much good faith as I normally assume, there is no sticking up for this one.  The article's [[User:Kobius|prime editor]] (and incidentally, the forum admin) removed the AfD tag from the page and does not take kindly to other editors touching 'his' page.  The whole layout of the article is clearly trying to draw viewers into the forums, perhaps to meet the admitted goal of 500,000 posts.  Add these to the issues others have pointed out and there's really no need for further discussion.

The Anizone is a large site and I think if someone wants to find out more about it they come to the best internet dictionary in the world and they research on of the largest best sites. The site has a largely amount of fair people considering it has been hacked three times. The admin accidently remoe it thinking it would be delete and he was not the maker of the page but it was I.

==BBC News Report and the pilot &quot;looking for a good place to crash&quot;==

The BBC article states that the pilot was looking for a good place to put the aircraft down; he missed some park and instead put the aircraft down in an uninhabited area near Stockport city centre. The evidence does not justify this supposition whatsoever. For one thing, the AIB report states that the aircraft was likely uncontrollable after the engines cut out, and might not have been controllable even before then. The first officer died and the captain suffered retrograde amnesia, so we don't know what went on in the cockpit. There isn't the tiniest shred of evidence that the pilot &quot;put the aircraft down&quot; someplace safe. It was likely just coincidence - there are a lot of empty or disused areas around airports and under approach paths (and *that* is often deliberate).

This is such a common urban legend/media foofah. Every time a plane doesn't actually fall out of the sky, some media type comes up and says the pilot was &quot;looking for a place to crash that wouldn't cause injuries on the ground&quot;. I don't blame the Wikipedian who put this in at all, because he/she likely didn't have any sources other than the BBC article. I am blaming the BBC for making a supposition not supported by the facts.

I suppose people want to think that in an emergency the first thing the pilot will do is look for a safe place to crash. It makes them feel less worried about an aircraft crashing into their home, school, or place of business. It ain't necessarily so, though; in fact it almost is never so. Aircraft about to crash are more often than not uncontrollable - that's why they crash. --[[User:Charlene.fic|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot; face=&quot;Matisse ITC&quot;&gt;Charlene&lt;/font&gt;]] 19:40, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

Edited to add: The cause of the accident wasn't &quot;pump failure&quot; (boo, BBC, again). It was a design error in the fuel line. --[[User:Charlene.fic|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot; face=&quot;Matisse ITC&quot;&gt;Charlene&lt;/font&gt;]] 20:02, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

:Apologies. That would have been my factual faux pas. Thank you for correcting my blathering and making this article respectable. :) [[User:Legion89|Legion]] 13:56, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

A second's more flight and the plane would catastrophically have taken the tower off Stockport's fine Town Hall and crashed into the facade of the (then) infirmary opposite the Town Hall, blocking the main road between that runs from Manchester through Stockport to the south - AG, Stockport.

== Additional cause of this crash ==

I remember seeing a BBC program about this crash. It reported on the findings of the inquiry. It said that there was an additional reason for the crash.

Apparently, the engine speeds were shown in the cockpit on two dials, one for each wing. Each dial had two hands, one for each engine and each labelled with the engine number.

This had been serviced, and a mistake had been made so that engine 3 was connected to the hand marked &quot;4&quot;, and engine 4 to hand &quot;3&quot;.

I think it was engine 4 that was starved of fuel. The pilot saw from the dial that engine 3 had stopped, so he switched off / feathered engine 3. Now both engines on the right wing were out. (This would explain why engine 4 was windmilling.)

As part of the investigation, they tried flying a similar aircraft with engines 3 and 4 both out, and discovered that the aircraft could not be flown properly.

Now, I mention all this because it is an interesting story. Also, because I want to apply the moral to setting up a computer cluster. I want to avoid the possibility of one computer failing and a different one being taken out for service by mistake, thereby bringing down the cluster. 

Does anyone know more about this? [[User:Mm67|Mm67]] 11:44, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

==Is [[Wikipedia:Notability (science)]] a consensus guideline?==
Please state your position, '''yes''' or '''no''', explain your position and defend it.  This is not a vote.  [[User:SmokeyJoe|SmokeyJoe]] 10:47, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Yes''' I consider it one, and I'm not sure what objection people have - if there's a problem that needs fixing, let's fix it.  I already refer to it, guideline or not, since it's very useful.  --[[User:Minderbinder|Minderbinder]] 12:38, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Yes''' Not only is it a consensus guideline, it is absolutely vital for Wikipedia to have such a guideline. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 12:51, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Yes''' I certainly support this guideline, what it is trying to do, and how it is trying to achieve it. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:10, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Yes''' We're ready to go into the stage where changes should be discussed here before being implemented in the policy page. ~ [[User:Trialsanderrors|trialsanderrors]] 17:40, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Absolutely''' We've numerous AfDs and arbcom cases which have documented that this is the community's intent. --[[User:EngineerScotty|EngineerScotty]] 17:44, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* I don't see where the proposed criteria add meaningful advice to writters or evaluators, and the preamble/text is way too long to be practical.  Please cite some examples of AfD where this proposal would have ensured an outcome other than what would have been achieved under the current guidelines.  For each of the criteria now listed I belive that proper application of WP:N and WP:ATT would acheive the same results.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 17:54, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
** There is [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Electric universe (concept)]], where this standard helped to refine the arguments that finally got the topic removed.  The aupporters trying to use this guideline to buoy their cause ended up only showing all the more that the article did not belong in Wikipedia.  &lt;br&gt;You are correct that in the end articles that are removed will be so removed (or not) due to policy concerns.  The need for this guideline comes from its ability to focus the debate on the issues that are important in the relevant cases.  In other words, it helps to achieve the &quot;proper application&quot; that you are claiming makes this guideline irrelevant. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 18:22, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
*** EMS, could your purpose be acheived with an essay?  Among the problems with permutations from guidelines and policies is the evolution into redundant and conficting guidance to the point that writers and evaluators become confused and the branches work at cross purposes.  My frequent analogy is the US Tax Code, which has bread several large industries for interpretation and application.  Writing complex rule sets requires great skill and caution. --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 18:34, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
*** On review of the Electric universe (concept) AfD, it appears to be resoundingly rejected with the tools we already have, most convincingly original research and few reliable sources.  This outcome is consistent with other scientific and academic issues which I have seen defeated at AfD. An excellent nomination doesn't hurt either! --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 18:42, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
**** Right now I am wondering what your agenda is here, as this type of opposition usually comes from someone who has lost an AfD in part due to this and the guidelines and is seeking to water down the standards.  One of the factors that helped with the electric universe AfD was the the nominator was also working on this guideline and used its insights in writing the nom.  Beyond that, there is the basic issue of moving beyond &quot;peer review&quot; as a standard for inclusion, a test passed by numerous non-notable articles that I have seen.  Also, I at least have gone to some pains to couch this as a setting standard for inclusions instead of exclusion.  That way, an argument that &quot;X calls for inclusion&quot; renders this guideline moot as a refutation, and so avoids the types of conflicts that in our laws make being a lawyer such a profitable profession. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 19:16, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
***** My agenda is not as you assert, but your question is a fair one, which I will answer.  My agenda is clarity in the grand scheme of notability guidelines, without a specific prejudice to this proposal. Please visit the discussion page for WP:N to see that there are many people expressing concerns over the whole process.  I support the concept of &quot;encyclopedic suitability&quot;, which we call notablility at WP, for lack of a better name.  I also consider myself a moderate inclusionist.  I am a frequent participant in Afd.  You are correct in one respect, that I origninally became involved in AfD and notability, because I saw too many abuses by uninformed editors who were deleting meanigful articles, though not specifically in the field of science.  My interest is in history and sailing.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 19:33, 16 March 2007 (UTC) 
******Might I recommend that your &quot;no&quot; comment seems to be motivated more by a general dislike for [[WP:N]] rather than a specific distaste for this particular guideline. In particular, the motivation behind this guideline was in part due to a charge made during the [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Pseudoscience|Pseudoscience arbitrartion case]] that such a guideline should exist to fend off charges related to whether an idea was notable in a scientific sense. One can argue whether [[WP:N]] should exist or not, but that's not for us to decide here. It is absolutely not true that this guideline is redudant: there is no other place where it is indicated what makes a scientific idea notable for inclusion in the encyclopedia. [[WP:NOR]] doesn't help because &quot;originality&quot; is a vague concept related to heavily to [[WP:V]] and [[WP:COI]] to be useful when people just make random articles about ostensibly scientific subjects they read about online, for example. [[WP:A]] doesn't help because there are scientific ideas which are not notable (the general consensus of the community is that they do not belong in the encyclopedia) which nevertheless are attributable to reliable sources. [[WP:NPOV]] doesn't work because the exclusion criteria at [[WP:NPOV#Undue weight]] is unable to distinguish between majority and minority except by [[WP:CON|consensus]]. That's why this guideline is needed and why it is used. Look at all the pages that link here and tell me that it isn't referred to. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 13:09, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
* No, it's not.  I think the burden of some evidence that this guideline is widely supported and necessary needs to be shown from the supporters.  Right now it's an initiative, a proposal with stable wording.  However, even in the &quot;test cases&quot; that I looked at, it seems that this guideline isn't being referred to, and evaluation of the articles in question isn't done with these guidelines in mind, rather, articles are mainly evaluated from a point of view of adequate sourcing and original research issues, in other words, policies we already have.  (I do think the editors here have reached a reasonably stable consensus, though.  But that doesn't, to me, make a &quot;consensus guideline,&quot; which implies support from the community overall.)[[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:04, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
**The evidence is in the ''What links here'' tool you can access from the toolbox. I think that you may have a hidden agenda here: you tend to be a bit too quick to agree to a supression bias against non-experts in the fields of science. Is this a misplaced concern? --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 13:09, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
***First of all there are over 150 things that link to [[Wikipedia:Notability (science)]], so it's not unreasonable to expect evidence to be actually gathered by someone trying to make a case.  But more, I went to a few of those &quot;what links here&quot; and apparently the only reason they were linked was that trialsanderrors mentioned that the debate was a test case: not people actually referring to the guideline and trying to use it.  Look at the Electric Universe AfD, for instance, which is the best example I've seen of a borderline-notable scientific theory (where this guideline might help).  [[WP:SCIENCE]] was not used as an argument in the debate, even by you, and the arguments that led to it being deleted were not even much along the lines of what is presented here in the guideline, but were according to core Wikipedia policies like [[WP:ATT]], [[WP:OR]] and so on.  Some of the argument is covered here in the introduction, but the &quot;criteria&quot; part played no role and seems to be central to this as a notability guideline.  So, this is what I mean when I say that no evidence has been presented.  What do YOU mean when you say this is a consensus guideline?  [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:43, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
****The criteria part played a huge role. The only criteria that EU could have come close to satisfying was recognition in popular culture/outside media and we showed that it was not notable along those lines. The guidelines at the time were being formulated and weren't as clear as they are now, but thanks to discussions such as that AfD we have a clearer demarcation. I think you need to read through the AfD we reference again and look carefully at how the criteria line-up with the criteria outlined in this guideline. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:02, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
*****Could you show me precisely where?  I don't mean to be dense, but I really don't see it.  I see your point #5 in the nomination, but that sounds like the core [[WP:N]] argument, and not related to the criteria here.  And anyway, saying the the EU debate influenced [[WP:SCIENCE]] kind of precludes that the EU debate can be thought of as evidence that this is a consensus guideline.  Can you show me ANY AfD debate that explicitly references the criteria?  [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:17, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
******Number 5 in the nomination. While it doesn't explicitly reference this page, it does so implicitly (and if I recall correctly at the time the standards were still being developed as to which criteria were going to be grouped with which). --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:20, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
*******Again, #5 was really along the lines of basic [[WP:N]].  Again, show me any debates that explicitly reference the criteria.  There's a difference between this proposal being wise or balanced or sensible and it having ''broad community support.''  [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:44, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
********Basic [[WP:N]]&quot;? That's a bit of WikiLawyering I haven't come across before. The fact is that #5 has direct parallels to our criteria here. You can thrust your head in the sand over this all you want, but that's the plain truth of the matter. And now you reposition your attack to claim that there isn't &quot;broad community support&quot;, but let me remind you that arbcomm members entreatied the community to develop these standards in the first place and that by virtue of this being a Wiki it will end up as balanced and sensible as possible. I'm beginning to think you are being a stick-in-the-mud for reasons you aren't coming clean about. Help me out, explain to me why you always seem to be fighting against scientific accuracy at Wikipedia so I can [[WP:AGF|assume good faith]] towards your contributions. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 17:36, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
***I suggest you go read [[WP:AGF]] and actually take it to heart.  In our current discussion, you seem to have trouble differentiating between (1) my personal support or opposition of the proposal and (2) my arguing that the proposal isn't a &quot;consensus guideline&quot;, that is, that it doesn't have broad support.  This wouldn't be a very hard difference to understand if you had been assuming good faith of me in the first place.  For the record, I support some of what the proposal says but not all of it, but that wasn't the basis for my objections: calling the proposal a &quot;consensus guideline&quot; is wrong, because this is still a very new proposal, barely even stable enough to judge.  [[WP:PROF]] remained a proposal for a very long time, and finally became a guideline when it became apparent that the guideline had influenced the way decisions were being made, and that the community, de facto, embraced the guideline.  Creation of policies and guidelines is slow and for good reason, especially when actionable changes are being proposed (like the criteria here).

****I appreciate your candor regarding your opinions of the content of this guideline because that is precisely what concerns me. However, I do feel that you are being a bit oblique in your commentary. &quot;Policy creation is slow,&quot; is often the cry of those who want to slow things down, and people tend to drag their feet for a reason. To me and many of the other editors who commented above, this guideline is ''de facto'' in place and isn't a proposal because we as editors abide by it. As you know, Wikipedia policies and guidelines are not written to affect change in the encyclopedia, but rather are meant to describe what actively goes on in editing. A good number of those who say that this is a consensus guideline edit a lot of science-related articles and so should be the ones to tell whether or not this guideline applies. I don't see that you are actively doing this as such. I do see you stepping into disputes regarding science-related articles often, and there are many times I see these actions as being in something of a contravention of the guidelines outlined here. I am being very up-front about my distrust of your motivations, but in so doing I'm also trying to assume good-faith as much as I can. Part of assuming good-faith is being transparent about one's perceptions and I'm offering you the opportunity to explain yourself as transparently as possible so we can move on. I don't like being lectured about [[WP:AGF]] when I was the one who brought it up, it looks to me like you are asking me to turn a blind eye towards our long history here at the encyclopedia and I am honestly telling you I'm having a hard time doing it because of the nature of this particular dispute we're having. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 13:53, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
*****You are making false implications about me, and I want it to stop.  [[WP:CIV|Comment on my comments]].  You say this is an attempt to document how Wikipedia works?  I respectfully disagree -- this talk page and its archives are full of debates about what the criteria ''should'' be, with very little discussion or analysis of how things are actually decided now.  (Some, but not much.)  From perusing the test cases, it seems to me that people are nearly exclusively deciding on these cases on the basis of [[WP:OR]], [[WP:ATT]], and [[WP:NPOV]], (and to a degree, [[WP:N]]), without much need for arguments specific to issue that the topics under discussion are scientific ones.  Since that ''isn't'' the content of this proposal, I cannot agree that this is documenting current Wikipedia practice, but if you want to try to change my mind, please show me specific examples so we can discuss them.  In any case, you should advertise this debate on [[WP:VPR]]; the general Wikipedia community should have a chance to comment.

******Whether they are false or not, they are simply my questions regarding your, frankly, obstinate resistance to this particular document. I am trying to be as forthright as possible here, and your increasingly haughty responses only confuse me further since you still haven't addressed directly my concerns regarding the history we have surrounding issues such as this. I disagree that the discussions are centering around how things &quot;should&quot; be. Rather I see discussions centering around generalizing from the experience that editors have. You also seem to be under the opinion that just because people reference older and more established policies and guidelines they aren't also considering this guideline. This I find to be particularly problematic because it ignores the words of people that aren't appended with a WP-acronym. Just because somebody doesn't cite this directly doesn't mean that you can't see the criteria being applied (as per our earlier discussion on EU deletion). I would hope that you would look more closely at the deletion discussions surrounding this and see if you can't spot the criteria in action. I am not going to advertise the debate anywhere, but you are free to do so. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 16:27, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
*******I've advertised the debate at [[WP:VPR]].  In terms of the status: you see one thing, I see another thing.  I'm not going to change my opinion by simply being told &quot;please look more closely,&quot; although you could convince me if you actually showed me some evidence.  I do see a lot of attempts at guiding the community: take a look at [[#&quot;Conference topic&quot; is a backdoor]], for instance, or [[#One final thought]]: people are discussing how to make a good rule, not what the rule is, organically.

****I'm with SA here: [[WP:N]] is being criticized partly because of its extreme generality.  No reason to think the entire idea of notability for all topics must pause just because of that.

****  The problem lies less with any individual sub-guideline, but more with a plethora of permutations leading to confusion.

***** I don't see any bedlam here.  I see this as being a well crafted guideline that is dealing with issues which are out-of-scope for the more general guideline due to its broad nature.  This guideline deals with the issues of science and science-related topics, and how to implement the notability guidelines within that context.&lt;br&gt;I have looked at the [[WP:N]] discussion and I get the feeling that you are doing your best to create uncertainty and confusion there.  And now you are trying to do the same here.  I for one have no need for it, and support this guideline as a reflection of the legitimate sense of the science editors here as to what is valid. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 18:23, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
*Yes, this appears to be a consensus guideline. The opposition to this guideline proposal may be part of a campaign in which User:Kevin Murray in the past month has placed &quot;rejected&quot; , &quot;disputed&quot; , or &quot;historical&quot; , or &quot;essay&quot; labels on about a dozen notability proposals or guidelines or has nominated them for deletion on the grounds that there was no consensus or that they constituted &quot;instruction creep&quot; or were redundant. A proposal is not necessarily impossible to reach consensus upon just because a few editors oppose it.

** I see your point.  This editor really, really has a grudge against the concept of notability, and I would love to know why.  If you want to do a [[WP:RfC]] against him, I am will be happy to second it.  This is ridiculous. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 19:42, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
*** No EMS, this editor, has a &quot;grudge&quot; against needless and redundant rule making for the sake of rule making.  I strongly support the concept of encyclopedic suitability which we call &quot;notability&quot; at WP.  This is not &quot;ridiculous&quot; but based on observations from life experience, that too many conficting rules create confusion rather than clarity.  Complex rule-sets require incredible cross coordination among the permutations, which is not happening here at WP, as guidelines are multiplying like rabbits without consideration of the big picture.  If you propose an RfC, please do so in the best interest of WP, not &quot;against&quot; me; this is not personal and reviewing the discussions will reveal that my actions are well supported.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 14:18, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
****There are plenty of Wikipedians who [[WP:IAR|agree with you about hating rules]]. However, might I suggest that you are going about it the wrong way. We are here writing this guideline because we need to summarize what has been done in regards to this issue. Your own personal distaste for the way in which editors have gone about doing this is probably best argued elsewhere: it certainly has nothing to do with whether consensus exists for this particular guideline. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:29, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
*** I do not see '''any''' need to coordinate this guideline with any other guidelines beside [[WP:N]] itself.  Although I am doing my own &quot;[[WP:NOR|original research]]&quot;, I have seem enough -uh- &quot;stuff&quot; offered by others such that I see a need to draw a firm and reasonable as to what is and is not acceptable here.  Until it has some reasonable amount of recognition in the scientific community, I see an article on my ideas as being an abuse of Wikipedia.  Yet I am unusual in that most other editors of Wikipedia with alternate ideas are here to promote those ideas, and they hate guidelines like this one with a purple passion because they help to keep their OR out.&lt;br&gt;BTW - I do see where you have had some success with you anti-Notability campaign.  Personally I think that you are doing Wikipedia a real disservice with it, and what you are stifling is not a bunch useless rule-making but instead needed elaborations on the meaning of Notability in various domains.  As has been noted in [[Wikipedia_talk:Notability|the WP:N discussion]], there is a level of subjectiveness in determining notability.  The need for these subsidary guidelines is to limit that subjectiveness, and thereby make this concept more usable.  Instead you are trying to pull the rug out from under Notability, something that will make the removal of questionable material much more difficult than it should be. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 16:08, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''the real test''' is whether the guidelines here will be accepted in practice. Both the above positions are to some degree correct: the guideline should reflect what its eds. believe to be the common feeling of the community, but it shouldalso point in the direction of where the consensus appears to be moving, and to be making recommendations from those most involved in edited these articles to guide thos less familiar. I think it will prove to be accepted because it is relatively straightforward, not complex -- at least by comparison -- and, in my view it does reflect the general voice. But we shall see. 
::The real dispute , I think, is over the notability of fringe science and whether that can be considered science in any sense at all. This is a matter in which I think there is in fact no real consensus, but at best a temporary majority, and i expect this  question to continue to be the theme of AfDs. I don't think this guideline  lays it to rest '''[[User:DGG|DGG]]''' 23:36, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
::: This guideline cannot and should not judge whether something is &quot;real science&quot;.  In fact, all that a determination that something is &quot;not science&quot; can do here is to remove a topic from being judged by this criteria with no resolution on its notability or lack thereof.  IMO, we have a set of criteria here such that anything that is meant to be judged as part of science can be ruled on here, be it mainstream or fringe.  What I think that you will find is that the least palatable topics are those which also have had the least impact and are also therefore the least notable.  --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 01:53, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

== Some suggestions on organizing this project page ==

* The introduction is too long.  Limit it to &quot;what&quot; and &quot;why&quot;.  Get the commentary (i.e. &quot;impetus&quot;) and discussion of process into its own section.  Specifically address what makes ''science'' different from other areas covered by the general guidelines.
* Criteria should define at least these categories as guidance to editors:
** topics which on their face should be include (i.e. the notable)
** topics which are going to require some judgments to be made by editors if they are new articles or added to existing articles. (i.e. the maybe notable)
** topics which, at least according to the authors of the guideline, are ''improbably'' included. (i.e. nonnotable)
* The statement ''&quot;Decisions about including or excluding material must always reflect the opinions of outside authorities, not those of Wikipedia editors.&quot;'' is bizarre because the opinion of Wikipedia editors is what, by definition, compose the Wikipedia. ''&quot;Must always&quot;'' is a rather strange term to be found in a mere ''guideline'' at any rate. [[User:Patsw|patsw]] 13:22, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

:: If you wish to draft an alternate version, the feel free to do so ''elsewhere'' and present it to us as a possible replacement.  We are certainly amenable to productive changes.  However, IMO the current project page works and should be considered a functioning guideline. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:13, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
:I agree the ''reflect outside authorities'' wording is odd (although not any odder than &quot;notability is not subjective&quot; which expresses the [[WP:ATT|same sentiment]]). The rest doesn't strike me as an improvement. ~ [[User:Trialsanderrors|trialsanderrors]] 17:49, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

::One point that isn't being made (in the intro) and probably should be is the point that scientific theories cannot be properly presented without understanding their level of acceptance.  There's a big difference between a mainstream theory and a fringe theory, and even in an article about a fringe theory, it's important to describe it as one.  However, for some fringe theories, insufficient sources exist to back up the claim that they are fringe theories.  Thus we are left with only one real choice: disallow the article, as we cannot properly cover it while adhering to [[WP:ATT]] and [[WP:NPOV]].  This is different from, say, an article about a band, where it may be that no source reports on their popularity or number of fans accurately, but sources do report on other things: the information we can't cover can just be left out.  In articles on science, we really can't leave that out.  [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:41, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

:::The &quot;level of acceptance&quot; argument makes no sense to me. &quot;Theory&quot; in science has a very precise meaning which applies to models and descriptions which are as completely accepted as possible in an endeavor based primarily on the dubious activity of inductive reasoning. While there is a big difference between mainstream and fringe proposals, the proposals themselves are only considered &quot;theories&quot; when they pass the tests of the scientific method. What makes a proposal fringe is, ostensibly, its inability to pass these tests. This doesn't mean that scientists don't make mistakes in pejoratively labeling the fringe out of the mainstream, only to say that the level of acceptance is something of a binary operator: either it's in or it's out. When an idea does not generate enough interest in the scientific community to create commentary from members of the community, it must either be uncontroversial (as is the case with textbook knowledge) or it must be outside the scientific community. This is quite easy to verify. No amount of posturing and insisting on the part of a fringe idea's proponents that the idea is actually &quot;scientific&quot; is good enough when demarcating for our purposes. We might still have articles on the idea if there is &quot;extra-scientific&quot; interest in it, but we do not need to shy away from being honest about its &quot;extra-scientific&quot; nature. One of the problems that many pro-fringe editors have is that they believe that because [[negative proof|proving the negative]] is in principle a defiance of [[WP:ATT]] that reasonable editors can't make editorial judgments with regards to the status of a particular idea. This is simply not the case at all: we are editing an encyclopedia not compiling a list of sources. After all, that's why we have editors in the first place: we are charged with summarizing the available data in the most conformist way possible. When all the data is outside the scientific community and the idea purports to have scientific importance, it is perfectly fine to delineate the contradiction. However, this discussion is probably better suited for [[WP:FRINGE]]. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:09, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

*I think it is a little more complicated than that.
*It is not ''necessary'' to give an indication of the acceptance of a theory, in order to describe it.
*And I don't think the word &quot;theory&quot; has such a precise meaning as scientists would like. For example, Wikipedia calls the [[Big Bang]] a &quot;theory&quot;, whereas the Encyclopedia Britannic calls it a &quot;Model&quot;. And I am sure there are more sources supporting both.
*This is why the new [[WP:A]] is so important. I can attribute both the Big Bang Theory, and the Big Bang Model, but I can find no source which agues it must be one or the other.
*I can also find no attribution labelling many minority subjects as &quot;fringe&quot;, nor claiming a certain level of acceptance. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 17:47, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

== Making this an approved guideline ==

I notice that Kevin Murray has downgraded this guideline back to the &quot;proposed&quot; status.  I would revert that myself, except that I am not at all clear by what action/authority it became considered a functioning guideline.  Certainly the above poll has produced only five people who support this as a guideline.  Even without the two nay-sayers I fail to see how the five of us constitute a group that can speak for the Wikipedia community as a whole, or at least the science editors.

I for one do call for the issue of approving this as a functioning guideline be presented to the community as a whole.  [[Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)|the Village Pump policy forum]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Science|WikiProject Science]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Physics|WikiProject Physics]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Chemistry|WikiProject Chemistry]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Biology|WikiProject Biology]] are all places where this guideline can be advertised and input and approval sought.  I see little danger in this and much promise, but mostly I would like to be able to show Kevin a formal approval so that is downgrading of this guideline cannot occur again. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 02:17, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

::We don't do &quot;formal&quot; and &quot;official&quot; with respect to guidelines. What matters is if this is (1) a good idea and (2) used as such in practice.

Judged by this talk page and AFD, the answer to all three is 'yes', so this page is a de facto guideline and Kevin is the lone dissenter here. Of course, putting a notice on the village pump never hurts.

:::Kevin is not the only dissenter, I also am.  Let me enumerate some general criticisms, this time relating to the substance of the proposal.  1.  There is not a big need for this.  Most science articles up for deletion are up for other concerns than notability, primarily, concerns that the article is original research, POV, or inadequately sourced.  Although there are many debates on the test pages subpage, in very few was the critical issue the notability of the subject: [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Electric universe (concept)]], [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Socionomics]], and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Growing Earth Theory]] (and the old debates, not listed there, about [[Time Cube]]).  2.  The list of criteria, a core part of this proposal, were not used as the basis of successful arguments in any of the key examples I listed.  Rather, the test seems to be the general one of being covered in multiple independent sources, inside or outside of the scientific community.  Note that the criteria give an opportunity to supporters of OR articles (real OR, not neutral attempts at describing published research) to argue for inclusion inappropriately: see [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sorce theory]] as an example of this.  The criteria have changed since then, but the same kind of argument could be made today.  I wouldn't want to jeopardize any of those debates by having a guideline here with such minimal applicability.  3.  The list of criteria is instruction creep and isn't useful.  For articles that should be deleted, not meeting the criteria doesn't make a strong argument.  For articles that should be kept, they're okay, but arguments to delete things that meet these criteria are weak delete arguments in the first place, usually along the lines of &quot;this article is in bad shape&quot;, see [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ubiquitous computing]] for example.  The criteria seem aimed at solving a non-existant problem of the over-deletion of notable science topics.

*The fundamental flaw of [[WP:SCIENCE|Notability (science)]], is that it tries to determine only whether an article is '''scientifically''' notable. It does not consider whether an article may be notable in '''any''' other area.

*: This is a true red herring IMO.  A failure of scientific notability does not mean that an article may have notability in another manner and therefore be worthy of inclusion.  I did have wording here to that effect at one time, but it seems to have been lost.  I will see to restoring that, as I see this guideline as being usable only as a means of inclusion.  For the purposes of exclusion, the failure of a topic to merit inclusion under any guideline (including this one) is the relevant matter. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:27, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
*:  (Edit conflict) Agree with EMS; The page clearly embraces the idea that popular notability for science topics is appropriate.  Since popular notability definitely is acceptable (see the [[Time Cube]] precedent, for instance), any wording that implies otherwise should be examined.  But you aren't correctly representing the main thrust of the proposal.

::*I did not suggest that failing scientific notability means that an article MUST be notable elsewhere. I wrote that it MAY be notable elsewhere. Yet the current policy does not consider this.
::*Deleting articles based on scientific notability alone, is an incredible conceit, and should play no part of the proposed guidelines. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 17:35, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
:::*I'm not sure what your point is.  If an article is scientifically notable, fine, it's keepable.  If an article is not notable scientifically, but notable in some other way (for example, in popular culture), fine, it's keepable.  But if the article is not notable in any way at all, why should it be kept?

::::*A number of articles have already been deleted, based on whether they were scientifically notable only, or worse, ''mainstream'' scientifically notable.

:::::* So what?  I see this as something that can and should happen.  If no other grounds are being offerred to justify notability, then the article should go.  I would point out that the deleted items cited as being &quot;non-mainstream&quot; are also considered &quot;non-notable&quot;, while other items have been kept as being &quot;notable&quot; but &quot;fringe&quot;.  It seems to me that this shows that this is a reasonable and workable scheme. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 22:09, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

::::::*No other grounds for notability are offered because the articles are considered only as to whether they are scientifically notable.
::::::*For example, the article on [[Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Ralph_Juergens|Ralph Juergens was deleted]] (a) based on a Scientific notability &quot;test case&quot; (b) on the grounds that he was a &quot;non-notable non-mainstream scientist&quot;, which is accurate, but no cause for deletion by itself.
::::::*It is improper for &quot;Notability (science)&quot; to '''solely''' judge any article for deletion, as it makes no attempt to attract expert editors in other fields --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 23:12, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

:::::::* If you are saying that a deleted article had another non-scince reason for being notable, then please name it and indicate why that reason was not considered at the time.  Also do note that in such cases a request for reconsideration can be made to [[Wikipedia:Deletion review]].  However, this standard is for determining notability with respect to science, and I find it to be quite silly and disingenuous to accuse this guideline of not doing something that it is not meant to so (namely seeking non-science-related reasons for inclusion). --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 01:56, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

::::::::* Ian, I hear you.  However your objections are ''way'' off base here, because what you don't like is that a consensus of Wikipedia editors has disagreed with your stance on certain topics.  That doesn't really have any bearing on whether or not that consensus exists.  You talk like [[WP:SCIENCE]] got Ralph Juergens deleted: no.  A consensus of editors and a discussion got it deleted, and frankly, it wasn't even based on [[WP:SCIENCE]] at all, more like on [[WP:BIO]] or [[WP:PROF]].

:::::::::*No, I am criticizing the make-up of the consensus, which is predominantly science-oriented editors who decided that Ralph Juergens was not notable because he was not a mainstream scientists; That is what the summary says. The AfD was not targeted outside of Notability (Science).
:::::::::*The main reason given for deletion of &quot;Ralph Juergens&quot; was that he &quot;is only published by vanity presses&quot;; not only is this false, but it fails civility guidelines,[[WP:COI#Importance_of_civility]]. Nevertheless, this was picked up by several other editors as their reasons for supporting the AfD.
:::::::::*But this is not the place to discuss a single article, but I offer this as an example. 
:::::::::*I think it is wholly inappropriate for WP:SCI to advertise articles for deletion. WP:NOTABLE should advertise AfD, giving a editors a chance to refer to WP:SCI and OTHER notability guidelines. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 10:46, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

==One researcher POV fails NPOV==
*The third paragraph includes an incorrect statement:
:&quot;the point of view of one researcher or research term and, unless it generates a significant outside response by the scientific community or the population at large, fails NPOV&quot;
*This is a complete misunderstanding of [[WP:NPOV|NPOV]]. If we attribute a statement to a single researcher, and it conforms to [[WP:A]] and is not misrepresented, then it conforms to NPOV. The argument is whether a statement by a single researchers is ''notable'', which is completely different. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 19:26, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

::*If another attributable view is available, we describe it. If it isn't, we don't pretend there might be one. There is no double whammy.
::*Describing the POV of one person does not automatically fail NPOV, and any decent editor can describe any POV in way that fulfils NPOV.
::*Quashing a POV on the grounds that there MIGHT be a hypothetical counter-POV, fails NPOV, fails WP:A, and fails WP:V. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 00:08, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

:::::*The only requirement to provide a balanced view, is if one exists. If it doesn't, then to pretend that a view &quot;needs balancing&quot;, is presumably based on the view of an unattributable, anonymous, expert-less editor. This fails numerous Wikipedia policies.

:::::*Yet both POVs are EQUALLY valid, as long as they are not misrepresented, and can easily be described in a manner that conforms to NPOV. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 13:15, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

:::::::What you fail to realize is that there is an informal community discussion as well as a formal publication discussion. Those who are in a particular community are aware of the informal discussion and are able to tell when a topic is ignored/scoffed or when it is accepted. This cannot be reported at Wikipedia for verifiability reasons, but it still raises NPOV concerns when certain editors try to force obscure research into the forefront of an article. You are mistaking a standard of verifiability (which is the standard for how to write an article) with editorial judgement: they need not be one-in-the-same. In other words, one need not &quot;verify&quot; that there is NPOV issues because, as editors, our editorial opinions do not need to be (nor can they be) verified. The only thing that needs to be verifiable is the text of the article. We are allowed to have judgements that are external to this. As such, it is perfectly reasonable to say that there are NPOV problems with someone citing a single, isolated, though published research paper. In terms of your dark matter red herring, you have totally misconstrued the situation, and I'm fairly confident that nearly any third party not firmly ensconced in pathological skepticism toward mainstream astrophysics would find your evaluation predictably myopic. Clowe's triumphalist attitude is only justified from the standpoint of [[standing on the shoulders of giants]]. It's not like he was publishing his &quot;proof&quot; of dark matter in a vacuum -- it was a particular point that was addressed to a particular (MOND-type) objection. However, when your hypothetical John Doe bucks the established research by publishing proof against dark matter, he is publishing in a vacuum. Prof. John Doe's work is marginal and therefore marginalized by Wikipedia. Clowe's work is mainstream and therefore reported by Wikipedia. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:47, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
::::::::SA is quite right about verifiability vs. editorial judgement.  However, I have to say I worry when editorial judgement of this type comes into dispute.  Wikipedia needs sources for two reasons: one is to have attributions in the articles, but another reason is that it levels the playing field in editorial discussions.  Inherently, experts on Wikipedia are not set above ordinary editors, but they may be more familiar with the subject in question.  But experts have to prove themselves, just like anyone else.  Fundamentally, Wikipedia is a community of equal editors.  So, this is a good argument ''for'' [[WP:SCIENCE]]: in order to avoid having to rely on editorial judgement too heavily, we look for a higher standard of quality in sources for scientific topics, and where that doesn't exist, we should avoid covering the subject.

:::::::::*Let's not mix up NPOV and editorial judgment. As I said earlier, the statement in the introduction is incorrect concerning NPOV. I also said it may concern notability, so I'm not dismissing the point. But let's be accurate as editors.
:::::::::*The idea that a community has informal discussions which a particular editor may be aware, is worthless. It is not verifiable, nor attributable. 
:::::::::*I know THREE different communities, all of whom have informal discussions, and promise peer reviewed papers that I could mention too. Also worthless.
:::::::::*An encyclopedia does not run on material gleaned from Chinese whispers via anonymous, unaccountable editors.
:::::::::*I had previously brought this up at the Neutrality Project, see &quot;[[Wikipedia_talk:Neutrality_Project#NPOV_misunderstanding|NPOV misunderstanding]]&quot;. They agree. A singular POV can be described in an NPOV manner. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 16:01, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

NPOV is inherently based in editorial judgement. The only way that someone determines whether there is a problem with NPOV is by making an editorial judgement. That's why the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{POV}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag comes with the wording it does. Disputes arise between editors over NPOV: if there was a singular editor there would never be NPOV issues from the standpoint of writing an article. While I agree with Mangojuice that editors are judged external to their status as &quot;experts&quot; (see ongoing conflicts over [[WP:EXPERT]] for example), the community doesn't deny the existence of experts either. No one is saying that the encyclopedia should be &quot;run&quot; on expert judgement or the whispers of whatever anonymous and unaccountable ethnic group, but people are saying that editors may come to the table with these concerns. That's the essence of the NPOV guideline: all the points-of-view are placed on the table and the marginalization happens per the outside community and references to the outside world. No one is saying that a singular POV cannot be described, but people are saying that singular POVs present unique difficulties when writing an encyclopedia that is supposed to be NPOV. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 17:39, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

:*Indeed, all the POVs are placed on the table. And if there is just one POV (because there is one WP:V/WP:RS/WP:A), then we can still write that POV so that it conforms to NPOV, regardless of whether you or I or anyone else agrees with the POV, and regardless of whether it is mainstream of pseudoscience.
:*In which case, the statement in the third paragraph that I described above, is incorrect. A view from a single researcher may fail a criteria, but there is no reason for it to fail NPOV; and if it does, any decent editor can re-write it so that it conforms to NPOV. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 19:19, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
:::If there is only one notable POV, then sure, we write about it. In which case the statement in the third paragraph is correct. A view from a single research written about on Wikipedia does have editorial issues related to NPOV for the reasons delineated because the alternatives may exist but cannot be included without falling into original research. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 19:23, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
::::*The statement is incorrect because a single POV does not fail NPOV unless it is written badly, in which case any competent editor can correct it. Sure, the statement may be allowed because it is notable. But it won't fail because of NPOV.
::::*A single POV that has been published elsewhere does not not fail &quot;Original research&quot;, because [[WP:NOR]] &quot;refers to '''unpublished''' facts&quot;. (my emphasis) --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 19:51, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

You are missing the point. Perhaps I should post here the statement that you dispute:

:''Research published in a reputable publication passes these thresholds but reflects the point of view of one researcher or research term and, unless it generates a significant outside response by the scientific community or the population at large, focusing on such research in a Wikipedia article does not adequately conform to [[WP:NPOV|Wikipedia's policy on neutrality]], in particular the section on [[WP:NPOV#Undue weight|undue weight]].''

You'll note that the point being made is that simply quoting published work is not good enough. Why isn't it good enough? Because unless the work in question has generated discussion it has not been vetted outside of Wikipedia to make it possible to write an article on the subject that adheres to the spirit and letter of NPOV.
--[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 20:36, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
::The POV of a single researcher in a single first-rate peer-reviewed publication, has normally been assessed by 2 or usually 3 independent scientists with a tendency to be ciritical. The assumption made by colleagues it that such results are correct unless proven otherwise. Are we supposed to be more critical of physics that he physicists who review for PRL? Then, if discussed by independent sources, as most scientific papers are, it is considered worth citing and commenting one. Reputable journals expect items listed as references to be relevant to the new work also. I'm a librarian. i think many articles in most library journals are basically trivial if not junk altogether.. But they are considered valuable by my colleagues in general, and its their trms that matter. I will judge by reporting theirs',  not imposing my own.'''[[User:DGG|DGG]]''' 09:02, 9 April 2007 (UTC)

:The statement which I quoted above, is as follows:
::&quot;the point of view of one researcher or research term and, unless it generates a significant outside response by the scientific community or the population at large, fails NPOV&quot;
:A single POV may fail, or being accepted by some other criteria. But a single POV does not fail NPOV (unless an editor writes poorly). 
:*To suggest that a statement based on a single POV, changes it's NPOV standing, depending on some other ''potential'' discussion whose view is yet to be determined, is illogical. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 20:46, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

If your point is that someone can attribute a single point of view in a fashion that is NPOV, that is absolutely correct. However, not every attributable point can be written about in a neutral fashion. An example of a quote that may be non-neutral though properly attributed and sourced is given at [[WP:FRINGE#Sourcing and attribution]]. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 00:01, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

:*Since describing a single POV can be achieved in an NPOV fashion, then the description in the third paragraph is incorrect which says that a single POV without response fails NPOV.
:*Judging/assessing a single POV is another matter altogether. But just because there may be no attributable assessments, does not make the description of a single POV automatically fail NPOV. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 00:34, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

I do not agree with the demand that not only must something be said in a respected peer reviewed journal, but that we must wait for other independent researchers to chime in, in OTHER respected peer reviewed journals, and agree with the first researcher that the claim is valid. The first post would constitute a reliable source satisfying [[WP:ATT]] and would be usable in a Wikipedia article. Similarly a book from a respected publisher would constitute a reliable source, without waiting for some other authority to write another book that says &quot;I agree with the first book.&quot; The demand places the bar way too high. It may be years before someone completely independent of the first researcher publishes the demanded blessing of the first researcher's claim. [[User:Edison|Edison]] 20:20, 9 April 2007 (UTC)

==[[Schmidt Sting Pain Index]]==
Can some of you knowledgable and discerning scientist Wikipedians take a look at this please? This article has currently been getting some coverage in popular &quot;gee whiz funny link of the day... how goofy!&quot; type blogs ( I hate it when this happens and the article in question is dubious... I think it gives a bad impression of wikipedia), but it seems to be mainly based on the idea that this one insect scientist guy wrote some goofy comments for an insect sting pain index one day. Ok, I agree that insect scientists are allowed to have senses of humour (WITHIN LIMITS, for the sake of us all), but I am concerned that 1) this scale is not really widespread and may be just one scale promoted by one guy without much acceptance in the insect expert community. 2) the pdf article linked which this wikipedia entry seems to be based on does not seem to say that Schmidt actually wrote those goofy comments. Its a bit ambiguous, but its seems to say that &quot;the media&quot; (without specifying what media) came up with the goofy comments to append to Schmidt's original dry scale(I think this may be another case where people exaggerate or misinterpret what an article is saying). I dont have any access to science journal databases, and am certainly no science or insect expert. But these concerns and quick scans of google books and google scholar led me to bring this issue to wiser heads. Thanks very much  for checking this out.

The index also has been mentioned in popular science pubs; though it doesn't appear to be taken seriously by scientists.  A scientifically-based pain index would be interesting (though I decline any offers to participate in such research); both this and the related Starr index appear to be little more than the opinions of the bug guys in question.  The article certainly dances on the edge of notability.  --[[User:EngineerScotty|EngineerScotty]] 05:30, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

******Ok, once again, in case anyone can actually respond on my point: the list of criteria here seems to be a misguided attempt to define reasons for notability that no one brings up in debates.  If the issue was the over-''deletion'' of science articles, having these criteria would make sense.  But it seems to me that the main thrust of this proposal is in the opposite direction.  These are just fodder for disagreement (see [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sorce theory]] for instance) and distract from the main point about the POV and OR issues involved in using only sources from a single author.

********Good: a direct response.  Two brief points: (1) Arbcom never asked for criteria, but they did encourage developing a guideline, which is different.  (2) The EU deletion debate looks very different to me - there, the argument was done from first principles and it worked very nicely, and it skirted around the edge of these criteria (no one ever talked about whether the EU concept was &quot;textbook science&quot; or had institutional support)... and as for extended discussions with Iantresman... I don't think the criteria will make one bit of difference, and that's not a very good reason anyway.  Long-winded debate... I don't think we should seek to avoid it as a general principle, debate is a good thing.  Criteria would simplify the job but scientific topics aren't exactly overwhelming the AfD lists.

== General notability guideline template ==
Since the general notability guideline is central to most sub-pages, someone came up with the idea of creating a centralized template which will be consistent among the permutations from WP:N.  Please see whether we can make this work here.  The text is meant to be fairly generic, but it may make sense to add text following the template for fine tuning, or help us to make the template more applicable if it is not reflecting the consensus for notability.  I certainly didn't get everything that I wanted, but I'm very happy to see the compromises that make this a fairly representive of the attitude of the project.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 01:12, 7 April 2007 (UTC)

==Merging [[Wikipedia:Notability (numbers)]]==
What are the thoughts on merging [[Wikipedia:Notability (numbers)]] into this guideline proposal?  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 19:15, 25 April 2007 (UTC)

I've added a brief section which is the meat from the numbers guideline.  This seems appropriately and neatly combined here.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 16:29, 15 May 2007 (UTC)
*It's a bad idea, as explained on the talk page of WP:NUM.

== Scope creep ==

I may be beating a dead horse here, but all the references to NPOV, proponents and advocacy make it seem like this is about pseudoscience/fringe science, and the discussion above seems to confirm it. As it tries to apply to specialised but uncontroversial science, not much of it bears any resemblance to reality. --[[User:Abu-Fool Danyal ibn Amir al-Makhiri|Abu-Fool Danyal ibn Amir al-Makhiri]] 02:29, 6 June 2007 (UTC)

== Proposal concerns (LV) ==
Note that I came here from a couple of AfDs which were trying to present this as policy criteria for an article's deleltion.  As I read down the line, I encountered several problems with the proposed guideline.  I apologize if any and all of the below have been covered in the Talk Archives, which I am not going to read now.

Problems that I have at present with the proposal:

*Introduction:
:* &quot;A topic that is acceptable under this guideline is an appropriate part of Wikipedia.&quot;
::Pretty sweeping blanket statement, to me.  No other Notability criteria I'm aware of suggests that &quot;if it passes this, it's in.&quot;  Indeed, it seems to violate the principle of a Guideline to me, which always limits itself to allow potential exceptions.  Further, each section usually defines which criteria are primary and which are secondary.
*Notability of topics related to science:
:*&quot;Decisions about including or excluding material must always reflect the opinions of outside authorities, not those of Wikipedia editors.&quot;
::I know this has been mentioned above, but I want to echo this concern:  Decisions about including or excluding material must always reflect the consensus of the Wikipedia editors.  Anything else beyond that is helpful clarification, or it becomes fodder for people to [[WP:IAR]].
::I'd feel much more comfortable with something like, ''&quot;Deicions about including or excluding material on a scientific basis ought to be supported by the opinions and stated facts of outside authorities, as per [[WP:RS|Wikpedia:Reliable Sources]].&quot;''  Start throwing 'musts' around in anything but policy (perhaps only unbreakable/unmodifiable policy) and you'll get a lot of irate editors, scientific or not.
:*&quot;Although publication creates verifiability and reputable journals are reliable sources, publication by itself is not a sufficient (and sometimes not necessary) standard for encyclopedic notability. Unpublished research fails no original research and often lacks verifiability, so it is unacceptable by policy. Research published in a reputable publication passes these thresholds but reflects the point of view of one researcher or research term and, unless it generates a significant outside response by the scientific community or the population at large, focusing on such research in a Wikipedia article does not adequately conform to Wikipedia's policy on neutrality, in particular the section on undue weight. This guideline clarifies how the Wikipedia community has applied NPOV to articles on scientific topics. It does however not apply to the inclusion of scientific research as authorative sources within articles. The criterion for such sources is not that they are notable, but that they are reliable.&quot;
::Wha?  Could this be any more complex?  I actually had to diagram this paragraph out to understand it.  My hypothesis is most editors will not.  Can't you simply say it is normally necessary to follow the general notability guidelines with respect to neutral, multiple, independent, verifiabile, reliable sources?  And if you do that, what is the point of this whole section - I'm seriously not understanding how this adds anything to present guidelines.
* Criteria / General
:*&quot;1. Widely cited. Papers covering the topic have been widely1 commented on in academic writing within the topic's field.
::2. Outside notability. The topic is notable due to significant coverage in reliable sources outside of academic publications.&quot;  
::So we want articles only commented upon widely by multiple academic sources, which also are commented on outside academic sources?  Seems pretty wide, to me.
::Aside from that, I know I read somewhere that Wikipedia is not just a general encyclopedia, but can cover articles appropriate to special subject encyclopedias as well.  Thus 2. might well fail, as most specialist encyclopedias I am aware of have many articles which would only be known inside the discipline the encyclopedia represents.
:*&quot;Notable topics which are primarily non-scientific... [etc.]&quot;
::Boy, I'm going to love the AfDs which try to define whether a topic is &quot;science&quot; or not trying to use this.  Not to mention the arguments you'll get whether or not cosmology (for example) has a scientific basis or not.  Not to mention you're setting up a criteria which is so subjective it will rarely-if-ever be able to objectively define where this guideline would be relevant or not.
::Also, you will get editors asking whether the guideline itself applies or not - something I don't think I've ever seen with any of the other specialty N's about the guideline ''itself''.  I don't need to know if Burpa-Cola has been covered in the Cola News and CNN, or if Billy Bob Arthbutnott has both parlimentary opinions as well as the Sun documenting his career to know that Corp or People:Politicians applies.
*Scientific terms
:Again, how does this get beyond neologisms in a way that Avoid Neologisms doesn't, aside from adding the words &quot;scientific literature&quot;?
*Numbers and Sources
:*&quot;1. Have professional mathematicians published papers on this topic?
::2. Is the sequence listed in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences? (In the case of sequences of rational numbers, does the OEIS have the sequences of numerators and denominators of the relevant fractions?)
::3. Do MathWorld and PlanetMath have articles on this topic?&quot;
:::This may be taken from WProj numbers, I don't know.  But are you stipulating that 2 and 3 are reliable sources? (The Sources section has exactly this same problem.  You're controlling what is considered a Reliable Source without allowing the Wikipedia community at large to define that.  I have a problem with that - if I were arguing Notability(Religion), I would not want it to say that the Bible is an authorized source and any other 'holy' texts by default would have to prove themselves.)
*Sources
:*&quot;Scientific discovery is often disconnected from public discourse, so standard methods of sourcing and verifying are not always applicable. A scientific topic which yields low hit counts in the Google test...&quot;
::That's nice.  The Google test is widely regarded as discredited anyway.  Yes, I know it's still used, but it's questionability is known.
::Also, verifying and sourcing is verfying and sourcing.  I believe what's being aimed at here is scientific notability may have a smaller and different base (with different types of sourcing) for inclusion than other forms of notability.  So why not say that?  Except that above you're demanding 'popular' coverage as well as academic.
:*&quot;Web (and library) searches should therefore be evaluated based on the quality rather than the quantity of the finds.&quot;
::Thus, you allow extreme subjectivity creep, unless you are going to make further instruction creep in what constitutes scientific quality.  (My Jung is better than your Freud.  My Hawking beats your Einstein.  My t test is better than your bean counting.)  Common sense might be able to dictate that, but science is full of periods of flying in the face of qualitative common sense and succeeding - because it's right.
:*&quot;The following is a list of sources with qualifications of their usefulness.&quot;
::Again, you're preaching what is and isn't acceptable as a source, without allowing the community consensus to decide this over time. 
:*&quot;Google, Yahoo.... [etc]&quot; 
::Uh, again, how is this any different from Google test?

Finally, may I invite you to consider that most notability guidelines are much less complex and much more tolerant of letting individual cases be decided as individual cases?  And I hope that the question about &quot;Have we reached consensus?&quot; is asking if you as the editors have reached consensus about what you want to present to the community as a whole, as opposed to &quot;Are we ready to make this policy ourselves?&quot;

It may seem like I'm pissing all over your proposal.  I hope it doesn't, because I'd like to see a Notability(Science) guideline.  But I want it to be one that's usable and used - I wouldn't do either with this, and I'd argue as need be when someone tries to use this as a vote justification (which will happen, whether you want it to or not.)  Sorry for the length of the diatribe.

The rejected tag is appropriate and should stand until there is adequate discussion here to demonstrate active interest in the proposal.

It looks like a number of the contributors here are no longer active at WP: Lantreman ws banned, BDJ and Science Appologist have quit, Minder Binder, Abu-Fool Danyal ibn Amir al-Makhiri, and Laughing Vulcan have not contributed substantially since June and at all since mid-July.   &lt;s&gt;Trials and Errors and Radiant are advocating reinstating this as a proposal&lt;/s&gt;, but I don't think that there are enough editors who see this as a need.

* What I see now is something that is so watered down and nebulous that it cannot act as a genuine policy.  If people want to revive this effort, then we need to return to a version like [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Notability_%28science%29&amp;oldid=117329647 this one] and work from there.  IMO, what happenned to this effort is that a number of people whose pet articles were running afoul of this proposed policy chose to get involved with the blatant intent to sabotage it and remove its impact on their work, and unfortunately succeeded in doing so.&lt;br&gt;IMO, there is a genuine need for a policy like this to clarify what &quot;notability&quot; and &quot;verifiability&quot; mean in the context of a science article, and how [[WP:UNDUE]] should be applied.  It may be that this is an issue that is best handled by the admins with the advice and consent of the community so that we can avoid the pitfalls of the past. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:49, 20 August 2007 (UTC)
*I see, if not frequent, so at least [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere/Wikipedia:Notability_%28science%29&amp;limit=500&amp;from=0 recurrent use] of this guideline/proposed guideline/essay, very much in keeping with the rather low number of science-related AfD discussions. Absence of discussion on the talk page certainly doesn't establish rejection. I agree with EMS that the two-item version is watered down beyond recognition of the original version, and I don't see any consensus for it. ~ [[User:Trialsanderrors|trialsanderrors]] 16:07, 20 August 2007 (UTC)
:: Per [[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines]]: ''&quot;A rejected page is any proposal for which consensus support is not present, regardless of whether there is active discussion or not. Consensus need not be fully opposed; if consensus is neutral on the issue and unlikely to improve, the proposal is likewise rejected. It is considered bad form to hide this fact, e.g. by removing the tag. Making small changes will not change this fact, nor will repetitive arguments. Generally it is wiser to rewrite a rejected proposal from scratch and start in a different direction.&quot;'' --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 16:14, 20 August 2007 (UTC)

::: It seems to me that a lot of work has gone into turning this into something that everyone can reject.

== Reverted to earlier version ==

I have reverted the article to the form of lat March, with some twaking of the lead and the first section.  The revised first section now has a simple first paragraph that states the need to this policy as succinctly as I can.  The next two paragraphs have had their order exchanged so that the farily dry &quot;relevance&quot; paragraph comes last.  The previous last paragraph has been removed as an unreadable mess.  (I believe I drafted that paragraph originally, but it really never worked as intended, and only got worse over time.)

The {{tl|rejected}} tag has been kept as a matter of form, with the {{tl|proposed}} tag just commented out but still present.  I for one would be happy to see this version go back to &quot;proposed&quot; status, but I want to see if others are on-board for doing that.  Let's just say that after having taken a rest, I am ready and willing to work towards acceptance of a functional version of this as a policy or guideline if others are. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 18:24, 20 August 2007 (UTC)

:Personally, I don't see a lot of point reviving this.  The criteria have always been an attempt to change practice rather than an attempt to document practice, and to most people, the criteria and the proposal are one and the same.  The criteria really haven't caught on, and from my experience, people rely on other policies for scientific topics, like [[WP:OR]] and [[WP:V]], and where notability is needed, the general [[WP:N]] seems to be sufficient and its use is accepted.

:: Having looked more closely at the edit history, I find that your attempt to streamline this two two items has met fairly stiff resistance.  Then again, that is little wonder since your proposed consolidation ends up being little more than a restatement of pre-existing policy.  The goal of this proposal is to set up guidelines that go beyond the current policies and which are adapted to the issues which are unique to science.  Wikiepdia has very much outgrown [[WP:NOR|&quot;No original research&quot;]] and the requirement to use [[peer review]]ed [[scientific journal|journals]].  What do you do with a source that is &quot;peer reviewed&quot; but where the peers are fellow followers of a [[fringe science|fringe theory]]?  What do you do about the use of [[Nature (journal)|Nature magazine]], which is highly respected but does not use peer review to help select its articles?  What do you make of a theory published in a respected scientific journals but on which noone has cared to comment except the author?  What do you do with the [[cold fusion]] controversy created by Pons and Fleishman back in 1987 which obviously is notable within science but which was never respected by it?  There will not be many of these to contend with, but when they do appear this guideline will be invaluable.
:::::Please excuse my comment here, but the article content of Nature is peer reviewed. Like some other journals, it has on rare occasions published things based on consensus of the key editors, without formal peer review. The news content is not, of course, just editorially prepared -- by the most careful people around. It was they who caught the similarity of the stem cell photos after the peer reviewers missed it.

:: You like to cite [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sorce theory]] as a place where this guideline did not work.  For that I solidly disagree.  That article's creator had to play all kinds of games with these criteria to make a case for keeping the article.  In the end, his attempts to make the article look acceptable only helped to do it in.  In context this is a farly powerful tool.  In addition, it is not going to do in fringe science articles.  For example, I helped by have an aritcle on a book by [[Halton Arp]] kept because it was noted within the field of astronomy and also gained some measure of attention from the public at large.  That press coverage (both scientific and popular) could establish notability as described here was helpful in that discussion. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 01:03, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

:::You might note that my reduction to two criteria stood for over two months without comment.  You may also note that coverage by press and by scientific sources were the criteria I left in place, since those are the only part of the criteria that are useful.  What I object to are the other criteria, like &quot;textbook science&quot; or &quot;popular belief&quot; that are redundant and provide loopholes for argumentative POV pushers.  Can you hypothesize an example where a topic is &quot;textbook science&quot; or has a &quot;prominent advocate&quot; or has &quot;institutional support&quot; where the topic would be acceptable for Wikipedia ''without'' significant coverage in independent, reliable sources, academic or otherwise?

::::I am not sure whether I agree with you or not. I certainly think that there are science articles that are best referenced by standard textbooks, particularly for articles that are at the level of high school or early university science. For example, we probably do not want to source a peer reviewed journal on [[density]] and we do not. Are textbooks reliable sources? If so we do not need to mention &quot;textbook science&quot;, but if they are not, we probable do. --[[User:Bduke|Bduke]] 03:09, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

::::::: As for the other criteria: you agree on 3 and 4.  6 is totally pointless, because none of the criteria would expire once met.  7 obviously must require sourcing to back it up or it's totally vacuous and anyone could claim it about anything.  And anything discussed in a legitimate textbook is already covered in a reliable source, and I highly doubt that we'd ever find a case where one textbook mentions a topic but absolutely no other sources do.  Yeah, I agree, if we pare it any further, the ''criteria'' say nothing more than [[WP:N]] does.. so maybe we should lose the criteria altogether, or just spend more time explaining the issues that arise in assessing the quality of sources, especially academic ones.

(unindent) I think that you have just made an excellent suggestions in calling for an explanation of how to assess the reliability and relevance of sources.  Given some of the issues I have had recently with the anti-relativists over at [[talk:Herbert Dingle]], this makes a lot of sense.  (In those discussions, at least one person would take anything that he could find from a &quot;peer reviewed journal&quot; as evidence of a conflict over relativity and the [[twin paradox]].  Said contributions come from almost unknown overseas journals and in another case a blatantly anti-relativity publisher.)  I would still keep the remaining criteria as a way of saying that those things are the primary hallmarks of scientific notability, while noting that other options for notability are not prohibited. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:20, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

:I believe that's better, but I still think we should remove the criteria.  The problem is, people always seem to conflate a notability guideline and its criteria, while all other text is ignored.  By not having criteria, we would force people to read the discussion about the reliability of scientific sources.  (Actually, come to think about it, &quot;Notability (science)&quot; may not be the best name.  What about &quot;Reliable sources (scientific)&quot;?)

:: The criteria don't exist for the benefit of those that would abuse them but instead for the benefit of those that are looking for good guidance on what is acceptable.  The creator of an article will invariably try to defend it against an AfD.  IMO, if the article's creator can make a case that their article is acceptable under this criteria and everyone agrees, then these criteria have done a service in helping people to make that decision.  Similarly, if people listen to the creator's case and conclude that it does not hold water, then the criteria will also have helped by focussing the debate on the relevant issues and helping to bring about the deletion.  So as I see it these criteria overall are helpful.  Besides, it really is in the absense of clear guidelines that you get the nastiest debates. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 19:01, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

(a) Notability, (b) reliability of a source, and (b) reliable of the facts in that source, are all quite different, and tell us how to describe information, not whether to include it. If Arp publishes some information in an obscure overseas publications, and Stephen Hawkins in in Nature, Arp's supporters will find his article more notable, and no less reliable. And if Hawkins is described in a textbook, then it tells us that his ideas have a wider readership, and neither are as popular as today's astrology column.  &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment was added by [[Special:Contributions/{{{IP|{{{User|84.244.165.174}}}}}}|{{{IP|{{{User|84.244.165.174}}}}}}]] ([[User talk:{{{IP|{{{User|84.244.165.174}}}}}}|talk]]) {{{Time|17:34, August 21, 2007 (UTC)}}}&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Abandon this as an unnecessary complication==

Whether a peer review journal, a textbook, a popular book, a university hosted website or a notable persons personal site  is sufficiently reliable, reputable, or secondary is probably best treated on a case by case basis, and in any case this is not a problem specific to science.

Are there any controversial articles that are better treated by Notability (science) than by WP:NOR, WPV, and WP:N?  I think not.  I think there are too many guidelines, especially where they overlap.  True science should only need to satisfy WP:NOR and WP:V.  Where the subject is not true science, or is borderline, a further test should be simply whether others have written about it.  WP:N provides this test.  A lot of work has been invested in this project page, but that is not sufficient reason to adopt it.  It is rule creep, and it does damage by obfuscating more important policies and guidelines.

There seems to be tendency here for some to want a guideline to provide a science-quality test.  This is not an encyclopaedia’s role.  The ascribing of “Finge science”, “pseudo science” or “lunacy” to any theory is a job for third party sources, not for wikipedia rules.  

EMS suggests that some nasty debates exist because of the weakness of this guideline.  Some elaboration would be nice.  Discussion above suggests to me that the relativity article needs work, not that wikipedia needs more rules.

This project page should be abandoned.  Science is well covered by WP:OR and WP:V, and where notability is needed, the general WP:N seems to be sufficient and its use is accepted. --[[User:SmokeyJoe|SmokeyJoe]] 02:08, 22 August 2007 (UTC)

It’s always about sourcing, specifically whether the sources are sufficiently independent, sufficiently secondary, sufficiently reputable (not a blog or similar), or covers the subject in sufficient depth.  These are all straight WP:N issues, deriving directly from a combination of WP:NOR and WP:V.  There is plenty of evidence of spirited debate in places about the science of the content involved, and this sometimes is uncivil, but such spirited debate seems to me to be irrelevant to the debates, and always a symptom of editors who are too far into OR editing and are not looking at the subject objectively.  This is why Notability (science) may do more harm than good.  It suggests that there is something special about science.  The criteria for inclusion in wikipedia do not depend upon the science.

==physics? i think not==
do not confuse the observer effect with the uncertainty principle. the uncertainty principle has nothing to do with &quot;observing&quot;, it has to do with measuring. the observer effect is a supposed effect of observing an event and the influence of your presence on the event. no one would ever have to actually observe a particle's position to obfuscate its momentum, the mere act of using the photons to measure its position, even if nobody ever observed it, would suffice.

-------------
don't you have to observe in order to measure?
-------------

Indeed.  But what does measuring have to do with Quantum Mechanics exactly?  

To measure is to observe the results of a measurement process [that ascertains the subject measurement].  Humans observe with their senses — the senses that humans have.  Other conscious beings, perhaps including computers, may have other senses with which they can implement tools for making measurements.  At the end of the day, measuring ''ALWAYS'' involves observing.  

Tools used by beings to make measurements are limited (in their accuracy) by various factors including the limitations of ones senses.  The often-mentioned example of bouncing a photon off of an atom to measure its position illustrates the problem with knowing the position ''AND'' momentum of ''THAT'' atom at the ''SAME MOMENT'' in time.  The concept usually centers on the fact that the position measurement photon will change the momentum of the subject atom.  But aren't there other aspects of this problem?  

In the limit (considering the non-zero mass of the atom and the non-zero energy of the photon), can one ever know perfectly even the position alone?  Perhaps so, since the mechanical inertance of the atom precludes its reaction at ''THAT'' infinitesimal instant in time.  

Why is not ''THIS'' example an instance of &quot;observer effect&quot; rather than the uncertainty principle, per se?  If one seeks only to measure the position alone, then maybe it is neither.  Then again, is it not &quot;Observer Effect&quot; even if the momentum is changed by measuring only the position?  One would think so.  

Well, what if we start with measuring the momentum &quot;first&quot;?  How does one measure momentum, anyway?  Again, we observers devise a measurement process that allows our senses to detect the &quot;answer.&quot;  Momentum is mass times velocity.  If we know the mass, we might then seek to measure the velocity.  Human observers tend to ascertain velocity by measuring position at two points in time.  For non-zero velocities, this means two different points in space, of course.  Yet, [instantaneous] velocity is ''DEFINED'' at only one point in space and time.  Thus, one cannot measure velocity (or momentum) in this manner: one must ''WAIT'' to ''SEE'' how fast it is moving, and this yields only an average (not instantaneous) value.  

Before continuing on to propose measuring momentum, per se, by some other means (say, smashing the atom into an obstacle at a known position), we should note that the Uncertainty Principle pertains only to Quantum Mechanics.  In ''THAT'' world, particles are not particles; rather, they are probability density functions.  The interpretation of this ''MODEL'' of a particle says the position and momentum of the subject particle are INHERENTLY uncertain by virtue of the mathematical model itself.  To precisely derive the position, one must manipulate the model in a manner that causes the momentum &quot;to drop out of the formula,&quot; and vice versa.  

The relationship between position and momentum described by Quantum Mechanics is somewhat like the relationship between the time domain and the frequency domain described by the Fourier Transform.  One can say that there is some similarity as well between position and velocity in Classical Mechanics.  In fact, the description above with knowing the velocity versus position of the atom is exactly that: Classical Mechanics. 

Following this line of thinking, one (''such as this user who is not fluent in the intricate semantics of Quantum Theory'') might be likely to reach these conclusions: 
 

'''1. Using &quot;particulate&quot; atoms and photons to describe the Uncertainty Principle of Quantum Mechanics is ''flat wrong''.''' 

'''2. One does not observe Quantum Mechanics.  Rather, one uses that theory to make calculations to explain the observations of certain experiments.'''

'''3. Measurements ''ALWAYS'' involve observations and therefore also ''ALWAYS'' involve the Observer Effect.  Perhaps this ''IS'' the “Theory of the Observer Effect.”'''

'''4. The Uncertainty Principle of Quantum Mechanics and the Observer Effect are ''fundamentally'' unrelated.'''  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:JimRodgers|JimRodgers]] ([[User talk:JimRodgers|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/JimRodgers|contribs]]) 12:54, 31 July 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

For some reason this article is more focused on what the observer effect is not. --[[User:Nathanael Bar-Aur L.|Nathanael Bar-Aur L.]] 20:09, 10 April 2007 (UTC)

From what I understood from other sources, the observer effect is basically the collapsing of a quantum system's wavefunction that happens the moment a measurement in made upon it (by an &quot;observer&quot;), therefore cancelling any superposition that may have existed beforehand, and giving specific definition to the renderings. Is this correct? --[[User:Nathanael Bar-Aur L.|Nathanael Bar-Aur L.]] 20:21, 10 April 2007 (UTC)

==Suggestions==
Current article states &quot;not that of the driveshaft, along the axis of the car&quot;.
Add a paragraph that illustrates this with the driveshaft of the front-engine, rear-wheel-drive Porsche 928.
Also industrial examples and diagrams from mechanical engineering and classical mechanics.
e.g. a torque tube to allign parts of a hinge operated by two hydraulic cylinders.&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/206.188.57.60|206.188.57.60]] ([[User talk:206.188.57.60|talk]]) 14:42, 30 October 2006 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;

== Diagrams ==
Can anyone find a picture of this? I'm having a very hard time picturing what this would look like...[[User:70.157.134.125|70.157.134.125]] 01:01, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

==Accuracy==
This page is not really accurate. Cars like the STS, Corvette, etc. have independent rear suspensions, and the torque tube is not used to transmit acceleration forces in these vehicles. Rather, it is because they have trans-axles in the rear of the car and it connects the trans-axle with the engine in the front. However, I am not enough of an expert on the subject to write a clear and well-written clarification so I have just added some templates to the top of the page. --[[User:Ozziegt|Ozziegt]] ([[User talk:Ozziegt|talk]]) 21:33, 1 July 2009 (UTC)

:Corvette since at least 1988 doesn't have a torque tube (unless they put one in later), and apart from the Miata I'm hard pushed to think of an IRS that uses one. I agree, this article is pretty horrid, it needs a rewrite rather than refs. [[User:Greglocock|Greglocock]] ([[User talk:Greglocock|talk]]) 11:13, 2 July 2009 (UTC)

:Corvettes since the late 90's do indeed have torque tubes, of the same type that the Porsche 924/944/928 etc use.  All the mentioned Porsches are IRS and use a torque tube.  Part of the probem with this article is that it lumps very diverse systems together;  the early Ford systems are completely different from the Corvette/Porsche systems.  Both are classified as torque tubes, but the article does not focus on the essence of a TT, which is the use of a smaller torque-transmitting element inside a carrier. The carrier may or may not be static and may or may not be carrying driveline forces (like the Fords). [[User:52FordF-1|52FordF-1]] ([[User talk:52FordF-1|talk]]) 15:44, 18 July 2009 (UTC)

::Yup my bad, 2005 Corvette (as a random example) uses a transaxle and a torque tube. Note that the Corvette system is different to the Peugoet one, as the latter includes an articulating joint at the front whereas the Corvette system does not. This is a big deal, to a driveline engineer at least.[[User:Greglocock|Greglocock]] ([[User talk:Greglocock|talk]]) 23:25, 18 July 2009 (UTC)

:Agreed. The article as written is essentially BS. A torque tube fundamentally counteracts the torque of the driveshaft; the alternative is that the torque is counteracted by the torsional rigidity of the frame (the net torque must, obviously, be zero otherwise the rear of the car would rotate). The torque tube often does transfer forward wheel force to the front of the car, but this is not inherent in the mere fact of having a torque tube: there must still be a mechanism locating the wheels longitudinally relative to the diff/transaxle. This is analogous to the usual need to locate the wheels relative to the frame (most simply, with leaf springs) in order to move the car forward.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/110.175.57.184|110.175.57.184]] ([[User talk:110.175.57.184|talk]]) 05:05, 18 March 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== simple definition? ==

It has been my understanding from looking through service manuals and talking to mechanics that the corvette style torque tubes are just an enclosed driveshaft that connects a front mounted engine to the rear mounted transmission (with fully independent rear suspension)

I guess it's not simply called a 'driveshaft' in a classical sense since it doesn't connect a front mounted transmission to the rear differential  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/184.57.87.173|184.57.87.173]] ([[User talk:184.57.87.173|talk]]) 20:38, 15 August 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</text>

'''''Hello!'''''

Thanks for uploading some pictures to Wikipedia.  I wanted to make sure you were aware of some of the requirements and good practices for uploaded images.

*'''Pick an image name.'''
:When [[Special:Upload|uploading]] an image, pick a file name that is descriptive, and unique.  Remember that many images may be uploaded about the same topic, and remember that names are case sensitive.

*'''Source the image.'''
:On the [[Help:Image page|image description page]], explain where the image came from.  If you created the image yourself, then say so.  If it's from the web, give a URL.  If it's a screenshot of a movie or game, or a scan from a book, give the title.

*'''Provide copyright and license information.'''
:This part is a little bit trickier, but it's very important.  The copyright of the image generally belongs to whomever created it.
::''If it's a photograph you took, or an image you created'' (modifying an image that already exists doesn't count) in software like [[Photoshop]] or [[GIMP]], then you own the copyright.  To upload it to Wikipedia, you must agree to license it under the [[GFDL]] (which allows anyone to use it, but requires that they give credit to the original author and requires that any further edit to the image be licensed under the GFDL as well) or release it into the [[public domain]] (which allows anyone to use it for any purpose without restriction.)  Do this by placing an appropriate [[WP:ICT|tag]] on the [[Wikipedia:image description page|image description page]], like &amp;#123;{[[Template:GFDL|GFDL]]}} or &amp;#123;{[[Template:PD|PD]]}}.  Be sure to mention that you created the image.  If you're using &amp;#123;{[[Template:PD|PD]]}}, you may also want to use &amp;#123;{[[Template:NoRightsReserved|NoRightsReserved]]}}, since there is some dispute as to whether one may grant items into the public domain.
::''If you didn't create the image,'' or the copyright somehow belongs to another party (like a screenshot, which you might &quot;create&quot;, but the copyright belongs to the author of the movie or video game), then you need to find another [[WP:ICT|tag]] that describes the copyright status of the image.  Images used on Wikipedia need to be free for our use and the use of [[WP:FORKS|sites]] which reproduce our content.  This means that images cannot have a restriction such as &quot;only for use by Wikipedia&quot;, or &quot;for non-commercial use only&quot;, or &quot;for educational use&quot;.  Images without a free license may be usable in certain articles under [[WP:FU|fair use]], but such a use should be justified on the image description page.

*'''Describe the image.'''
:To another reader, the image may not be immediately understood.  A caption in an article doesn't explain the image to a visitor who sees it on its image page.  Put a brief explanation of what is in the image on the image description page, similar to what you might include in a caption on an article.  

Some links to Wikipedia pages on this subject: 

'''[[Wikipedia:Copyrights#Image guidelines|Copyrights]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags|Copyright tags]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Fair use|Fair use]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Image description page|Image description page]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Granting work into the public domain|Public domain]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion|Images for deletion]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Possibly unfree images|Possibly unfree images]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Copyright problems|Copyright problems]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Uploading images|Uploading images]]'''

Thanks again for your contributions.  If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me at my talk page. [[User:Feydey|feydey]] 19:42, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

An '''anti-submarine missile'''  is a [[standoff missile|standoff]] [[anti-submarine weapon]]. Often a variant of [[anti-ship missile]] designs an anti-submarine systems typically use a [[jet engine|jet]] or [[rocket engine|rocket]] engine, to deliver: an [[explosive material|explosive]] [[warhead]] aimed directly at a [[submarine]]; a [[depth charge]], or;  a homing [[torpedo]] that is carried from a launch ship, or other  platform, to the vicinity of a target.
[[File:Ikara missile.JPG|thumb|right|&lt;small&gt;[[Ikara (missile)|Ikara]], an [[Australia]]n-designed missile used by several navies between the 1960s and 1990s; a [[rocket engine|rocket]]-parachute delivery system carried an [[acoustic torpedo]] up to 10 nautical miles (19 km) after launch. A variant re-designed in the UK and used by the Royal Navy could deliver a [[Nuclear depth bomb|nuclear depth charge]].&lt;/small&gt;]]
[[File:Maille-Braize-14.jpg|thumb|&lt;small&gt;The [[Malafon]], used by the French Navy between 1966 and 1997, used a rocket-assisted glider to carry a torpedo up to 8 nautical miles (13 km) after launch&lt;/small&gt;. ]]

==History==
[[Depth charge]]s were the earliest weapons designed for use by ships against submerged [[submarine]]s. These explosives were initially dropped as the ship moved over the presumed location of a submarine. Before World War II, shipboard [[sonar]] was unable to maintain contact with a submarine at close range. 

Various [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]]-type projectors, including [[hedgehog (weapon)|hedgehog]] and [[squid (weapon)|squid]], were devised during [[World War II]] to allow a ship to maintain sonar contact while lobbing explosive charges toward the submarine.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Terry, and Costello, John ''The Battle of the Atlantic'' (1977) Dial Press {{Listed Invalid ISBN|0-8037-6454-2}} pp.307-308&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the [[Cold War]], [[missile]]s were developed to provide greater range with reduced [[recoil]]. Some missiles and rockets carry [[homing torpedo]]es to provide terminal guidance for the warhead.&lt;ref&gt;Albrecht, Gerhard ''Weyer's Warships of the World'' (1969) United States Naval Institute p.385&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''northern river shark''' or '''New Guinea river shark''' (''Glyphis garricki'') is a [[species]] of [[requiem shark]], in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Requiem shark|Carcharhinidae]] found in scattered [[tidal river]]s and associated coastal waters in northern [[Australia]] and in [[Papua New Guinea]]. This species inhabits areas with poor visibility, soft bottoms, and large [[tide]]s, with immature sharks ranging into [[freshwater|fresh]] and [[brackish water]]. It is similar to other river sharks in having a stocky grey body with a high back, tiny eyes, and broad fins. It measures up to {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} long.

Northern river sharks are likely [[piscivorous]]. This species is [[viviparous]], with females bearing litters of 9 young possibly every other year before the [[wet season]]. Very rare and facing threats from [[commercial fishing|commercial]] and [[recreational fishing]], and perhaps also [[habitat degradation]], this species has been assessed as [[Critically Endangered]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]].

==Taxonomy==
The first known specimens of the northern river shark, two newborn males from Papua New Guinea, were discovered by [[New Zealand]] [[ichthyologist]] [[Jack Garrick]], after whom the species was eventually  named. This shark was referred to as &quot;''Glyphis'' sp. C&quot; until 2008, when it was formally described by [[Leonard Compagno]], William White, and [[Peter R. Last]] in a [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] paper. The [[type specimen]] is a female {{convert|67|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, collected from the [[East Alligator River]], [[Kakadu National Park]], [[Northern Territory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Compagno, L.J.V. |author2=W.T.

==Distribution and habitat==
The northern river shark has been reported from [[King Sound]], the [[Ord River]], and Doctors Creek near [[Derby, Western Australia]], the [[Adelaide River|Adelaide]] and [[Alligator Rivers]] in Australia's [[Northern Territory]], and the [[Daru]] region and possibly the [[Fly River]] in Papua New Guinea. It inhabits large [[river]]s, [[estuaries]], and coastal [[bay]]s, all of which are characterized by high [[turbidity]], silty or muddy bottoms, and large tides. Young and juvenile sharks are found in fresh, brackish, and salt water ([[salinity]] ranging from 2 to 36 ppt), whereas adults have only been found in marine environments.&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pillans et al&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pillans, R.D. |author2=J.D.

==Description==
Like other members of its genus, the northern river shark has a stocky body with a high back. The head is wide and flattened, with a broadly rounded snout and minute eyes equipped with [[nictitating membrane]]s. Each [[nostril]] is divided into a very large incurrent opening and a small excurrent opening by a triangular skin flap. The sizable mouth is broadly arched, with short furrows at the corners. Thirty-one to 34 tooth rows are in the upper jaw and 30&amp;ndash;35 tooth rows are in the lower jaw; the upper teeth are upright and triangular with serrated edges, while the lower teeth are narrower and straight to slightly curved. In the largest individuals, the first few lower teeth from the jaw median are spear-shaped with serrations near the tip.&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;/&gt;

The [[pectoral fin]]s are large and broad, with gently backward-curving margins and pointed tips. The [[pelvic fin]]s are triangular with nearly straight trailing margins. The first [[dorsal fin]] is long-based and triangular, with the apex almost forming a right angle; the second dorsal fin is some two-thirds as high as the first. The origin of the first dorsal fin lies over the pectoral fin insertions, while that of second dorsal fin lies over the pelvic fin rear tips. No ridge exists between the dorsal fins. The [[anal fin]] is smaller than the second dorsal fin and has a strong notch in the rear margin. The [[caudal fin]] has a strong lower lobe and a long, narrow upper lobe with a ventral notch near the tip. The [[dermal denticle]]s are small, oval, and overlapping, bearing three horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth. This shark is steel-gray above and white below; the color transition is sharp, located well below the eye, and becomes jagged on the sides of the trunk. The anal and caudal fins become dusky or black towards the trailing margins and tips. The maximum known length is {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}}. This species differs from the [[speartooth shark]] (''G. glyphis'') in several [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] and [[meristic]] characters, including having fewer [[vertebra]]e (137&amp;ndash;151 versus 213&amp;ndash;222) and a lower, jagged gray-white color boundary.&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;/&gt;

==Biology and ecology==
With its slender teeth, small eyes, and high density of [[ampullae of Lorenzini]], the northern river shark seems to be [[adaptation|adapted]] for hunting [[fish]] in conditions of poor visibility. In Doctors Creek, sharks may move to and from favored feeding areas with the tide.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thorburn, D.C., D.L. Morgan, A.J. Rowland and H.S. Gill. (February 2004). [http://www.environment.gov.au/coasts/publications/pubs/glyphis-wa.pdf The northern river shark (''Glyphis'' sp. C) in Western Australia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108234623/http://environment.gov.au/coasts/publications/pubs/glyphis-wa.pdf |date=8 November 2011 }}. Report to the National Heritage Trust, Murdoch University. Retrieved on 10 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Like other requiem sharks, this species is [[viviparous]], with the developing [[embryo]]s forming a [[placenta]]l connection to their mother after exhausting their supply of [[yolk]]. Females give birth around October, before the start of the [[wet season]], on possibly a biennial cycle. One female examined contained nine [[fetus]]es.&lt;ref name=&quot;pillans et al&quot;/&gt; The young are born at under {{convert|67|cm|in|abbr=on}} long; males [[sexual maturity|mature]] between lengths of {{convert|1.2|and|1.4|m|ft|abbr=on}}, while females mature between lengths of {{convert|1.4|and|1.7|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;/&gt;

==Human interactions==
The northern river shark appears to be extremely rare, though more subpopulations may remain to be discovered in Australia and Papua New Guinea. Based on present information, no more than 250 mature individuals are estimated to exist in the wild, with no more than 50 in any particular subpopulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt; This species is caught legally and illegally by [[commercial fisheries]] using [[longline fishing|longlines]] and [[gillnet]]s, as well as by [[recreational fishing|recreational fishers]]; [[habitat degradation]] may pose a further threat to its survival. Because of its low natural abundance, limited distribution, stringent habitat requirements, and susceptibility to various human-caused threats, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] has assessed the northern river shark as [[critically endangered]]. It has also been listed as endangered on the 1999 Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, and on the 2000 Territory Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act. Kakadu National Park may be an important protected area for this species.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt; No regulations restrict the capture of this species in Papua New Guinea.&lt;ref name=&quot;white et al&quot;/&gt;

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Zoidberg. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Zoidberg~enwiki that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]]. If you think you might own all of the accounts with this name and this message is in error, please visit [[Special:MergeAccount]] to check and attach all of your accounts to prevent them from being renamed.

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== Hare Krishna picture ==

There is a picture of a Hare Krishna procession in the [[Religion_in_Mexico#Buddhism|Buddhism]] section, even with a caption about them being buddhists. Hare Krishnas are not buddhists, they are hindus. The article is semi-protected so I can not correct that myself. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Wenzelkarbovski|Wenzelkarbovski]] ([[User talk:Wenzelkarbovski|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Wenzelkarbovski|contribs]]) 17:39, 22 April 2015 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Self-ascription fallacy ==

''The last census reported, by self-ascription, that over 95% of the population is Christian.''

The so-called self-ascription of the census is nothing but a silly way of measuring data. Obviously they count children as Christians just because their parents say so. This people should either be clear about this or not count children at all. By the way, since a couple of years ago the Catholic Church has started to indoctrinate [[Huichol]] kids. Shame on us, Mexicans. Shame on us... The Huichols were one of the very few indigenous people whose religious tradition haven't been polluted by Catholicism but now the church has started taking advantage of the poverty of this people and the new constitutional reforms to infiltrate to their villages and improvise &quot;schools&quot;. Of course they know that adults wouldn't let themselves be indoctrinated so they choose to attack young minds. Catholicism and ignorance have been the ingredients of our condition as a Third World country.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Scandza|Scandza]] ([[User talk:Scandza|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Scandza|contribs]]) 13:27, 30 May 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;


Can anyone explain why the Evangelical Free Church of America does so many, many missionary trips to Mexico, when it's a predominantly catholic country? I mean, there are definite ideological differences involved, but I wasn't aware the two churches actively tried to convert each other's members.


==First phrase==

Any interest in removing &quot;Unlike some other Latin American countries&quot; from the first sentence of the article? It does not seem to serve any objective purpose and seems slightly antagonistic.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Namenderkrieg|Namenderkrieg]] ([[User talk:Namenderkrieg|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Namenderkrieg|contribs]]) 15:34, 24 March 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Easter==

I'm removing this:

&quot;Some of them however, do not celebrate Easter because they think that the Easter Bunny is the devil. Instead of celebrating Easter, they like to eat Mexican Pizzas.&quot;

because it's obviously untrue and just stupid. I think the article should be rewritten though, by someone more experienced than I am.--[[User:PARCGOP|PARCGOP]] 14:09, 7 April 2007 (UTC)

==Contradiction?==
This article says that 95% of people in Mexico are Roman Catholic.  The Mexico article states that 95% of people are Christian, and only 89% are Roman Catholic.  Which is correct, or am I just confused?
[[User:Yumecosmos|Yumecosmos]] ([[User talk:Yumecosmos|talk]]) 02:20, 9 January 2008 (UTC)

== Rewriting ==

I have imported the Religion section from the article on [[Mexico]] and integrated the information that was only on this article. I also moved around paragraphs and added a subtitle to make reading easier. Finally I removed the stub templates and replaced it with the expand one. --[[User:Marianika|Marianika]] ([[User talk:Marianika|talk]]) 16:32, 19 May 2008 (UTC)

== What about non-believers? ==

What about atheists, agnostics, deists in Mexico? How many Mexicans actually believe in God? Is there any data about that?  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/213.196.243.113|213.196.243.113]] ([[User talk:213.196.243.113|talk]]) 22:41, 27 May 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Mexican Ethnic Religion (Mexicayotl) ==

This article lacks a part about the growing movement of Mexicayotl, or Ethnic Mexican Culture or Religion, which is the revival of &quot;Aztec&quot; religion. --[[Special:Contributions/79.45.49.143|79.45.49.143]] ([[User talk:79.45.49.143|talk]]) 12:47, 16 August 2010 (UTC)

== Typo in Nonreligious section ==

'''John Ralph Ragazzini''' (January 3, 1912&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pnxBAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=John+Ralph+Ragazzini+1912&amp;dq=John+Ralph+Ragazzini+1912&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjC4sew9dPVAhXMHJoKHeWmAFsQ6AEIKzAB Profile of John Ralph Ragazzini]&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; November 22, 1988) was an [[United States|American]] [[electrical engineer]] and a professor of [[Electrical Engineering]]. 

==Biography==
Ragazzini was born in [[Manhattan, New York City]] and received the degrees of B.S. and E.E. at the [[City College of New York]] in 1932 and 1933 and earned the degrees of A.M. and Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at [[Columbia University]] in 1939 and 1941.

Ragazzini was dean of the School of Engineering and Science at [[New York University]] and during [[World War II]] he was chairman of the Department of Electrical Engineering at Columbia University, where he was involved in the [[Manhattan Project]].

Ragazzini's notable students are [[Rudolf E. Kálmán]] (see [[Kalman filter]]s), [[Eliahu Ibraham Jury]] (see [[Z-transform]]), [[Gene F. Franklin]] (see [[digital control]]), and [[Lotfi Asker Zadeh]] (see [[Fuzzy sets]] and [[Fuzzy logic]]).

Ragazzini is also credited, along with Lotfi Zadeh, in 1952, to have pioneered the development of the [[z-transform]] method in [[discrete-time]] [[signal processing]] and analysis.

In 1970 he received the [[Rufus Oldenburger Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asme.org/about-asme/honors-awards/achievement-awards/rufus-oldenburger-medal |title=Rufus Oldenburger Medal |publisher=[[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] |accessdate={{Format date|2013|2|14}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, [[American Automatic Control Council]] named [[John R. Ragazzini Award]] after Ragazzini and he was the first recipient of the award. Ragazzini died on 22 November 1988, aged 76.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/24/obituaries/john-ragazzini-76-educator-and-engineer.html&lt;/ref&gt;

I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under [[Wikipedia:Fair use|fair use]] but there is no [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline|explanation or rationale]] as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags/Fair use|boilerplate fair use template]], you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with [[WP:FU|fair use]].

Please go to [[:Image:Brokeninpieces.jpg|the image description page]] and edit it to include a [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline |fair use rationale]]. Using one of the templates at [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline]] is an easy way to insure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template. Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.

If there is other other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on the other images used on this page.

The '''United Church, Chapel on the Hill''' in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]] was the city's main church during [[World War II]]. Dedicated on September 30, 1943 and completed late in October 1943, it was originally a multi-denominational [[chapel]] shared by [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and [[Judaism|Jewish]] congregations.&lt;ref name=NationalRegister/&gt;&lt;ref name=churchhistory&gt;[http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=category&amp;sectionid=4&amp;id=39&amp;Itemid=55 Church History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728092956/http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=category&amp;sectionid=4&amp;id=39&amp;Itemid=55 |date=July 28, 2011 }}, United Church, Chapel on the Hill website, accessed March 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architectural design ==
The building design is a [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] 700-series [[U.S. Army]] chapel.&lt;ref name=Townsite&gt;[http://oakridgevisitor.com/history/pdf/OriginalTownSites.pdf Chapel on the Hill] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517124718/http://oakridgevisitor.com/history/pdf/OriginalTownSites.pdf |date=May 17, 2008 }} in ''Jackson Square – the original Townsite'', Oak Ridge Convention and Visitors' Bureau&lt;/ref&gt; It is a frame building built on a three-bay rectangular plan with a [[Steeple (architecture)|steeple]]d [[bell tower]] and a [[gable]] entry [[porch]]. It was one of three Army chapels built using the same design in Oak Ridge during World War II. One of the other two chapels, the West Chapel in the city's West Village area, was later torn down, but the East Chapel in the East Village is still in use.&lt;ref name=NationalRegister&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfo.doe.gov/me70/history/NPSweb/Oak_Ridge_Historic_District_(Preferred).pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form for Oak Ridge Historic District |date=July 18, 1991 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829041710/http://www.cfo.doe.gov/me70/history/NPSweb/Oak_Ridge_Historic_District_%28Preferred%29.pdf |archivedate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The U.S. Army built the chapel to house religious activities, as one of numerous community facilities in the &quot;townsite&quot; area of Oak Ridge. The building was dedicated on September 30, 1943, in a ceremony that included [[prayer]]s and talks by a Jewish [[rabbi]], a [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|Catholic priest]], an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] priest, a [[Baptist]] minister, and the [[minister (Christianity)|minister]] who was serving the United Church congregation that eventually came to own the chapel.&lt;ref&gt;Charles W. Johnson and Charles O. Jackson (1981), ''City Behind a Fence: Oak Ridge, Tennessee, 1942-1946''. The University of Tennessee Press. Pages 127-129.&lt;/ref&gt; Its name, &quot;The Chapel on the Hill,&quot; comes from a reference in a prayer by the Knoxville Baptist minister who participated in the dedication.&lt;ref name=Townsite/&gt;

The United Church congregation that is housed in the Chapel on the Hill traces its history to July 18, 1943, when some 25 to 30 Christians of diverse denominational backgrounds gathered for Sunday worship in Oak Ridge's main [[cafeteria]]. Subsequently, several members of the group made plans to establish an interdenominational Protestant church, led by [[laity|layperson]]s, to include all denominations. A [[Presbyterian]] minister working in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] was engaged to conduct weekly services, and about 150 people representing 13 Protestant denominations became charter members of &quot;the United Church&quot;. Governing boards of laypersons elected to lead the new congregation took up their duties on October 24, 1943.&lt;ref name=pre1980&gt;[http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=51&amp;Itemid=55 Pre-1980 Historical Compilation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728093006/http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=51&amp;Itemid=55 |date=July 28, 2011 }}, United Church, Chapel on the Hill website, accessed March 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Chapel-on-the-Hill was completed that same month, the United Church and the local Roman Catholic Church were given control of the building, as the only two churches then officially operating in the [[Manhattan Project]] community. During the war, when Oak Ridge's Manhattan Project facilities were operating around the clock, the chapel building was also in use nearly 24 hours a day as a venue for worship services, [[wedding]]s, and other occasions for local workers of various Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish religious backgrounds.&lt;ref name=pre1980/&gt;

At the peak of wartime activity in Oak Ridge, when the population exceeded 70,000, the United Church employed four ministers and conducted worship services in the Chapel on the Hill, East Village Chapel, and the Jefferson Theater, as well as [[Sunday school]] classes in several local schools and a [[mobile home|trailer]] camp. By 1951, the United Church Chapel-on-the-Hill consolidated as a single [[interdenominational]] congregation, making its home in the Chapel on the Hill building.&lt;ref name=pre1980/&gt;

The United Church congregation purchased the chapel and {{convert|3.72|acre|ha}} of land from the [[U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]] on May 11, 1955 for a price of $17,116.&lt;ref name=pre1980/&gt; An adjoining educational building was added in 1956-1957.

It is felt that the article you created at [[Ethan cavett]] is not suitable for a Wikipedia article, which must have a [[Wikipedia:Notability|notable]] subject and be [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verifiable]]. I have moved it to [[User:{{PAGENAME}}]], which is where users are free to write about themselves. You are at liberty to move it back into the (Main) namespace but bear in mind that if you do so, it is likely to be nominated for deletion. 

Note, however, that the purpose of a user page is to enable active editors of Wikipedia to introduce themselves to other editors. [[WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_a_blog.2C_webspace_provider.2C_or_social_networking_site|Wikipedia is not a general hosting service]], so your user page is not a personal homepage. Content unrelated to Wikipedia or its editing is likely to be removed.

Please see [[WP:User_page|the user page guidelines]], especially [[WP:User_page#What_can_I_not_have_on_my_user_page.3F|this section]] for more information. -- [[User:Omicronpersei8|Omicronpersei8]] ([[User talk:Omicronpersei8|talk]]) 19:36, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

'''Archer''' is a [[slab serif]] typeface designed in 2001 by [[Tobias Frere-Jones]] and [[Jonathan Hoefler]] for use in ''[[Martha Stewart Living]]'' magazine. It was later released by [[Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones]] for commercial licensing.

==Structure==

The typeface is a [[Slab_serif#Geometric_model|geometric]] slab serif, one with a geometric design similar to sans-serif fonts. It takes inspiration from mid-twentieth century designs such as [[Rockwell (typeface)|Rockwell]].

The face is unique for combining the geometric structure of twentieth-century European slab-serifs but imbuing the face with a domestic, less strident tone of voice. [[Ball terminal|Balls]] were added to the upper terminals on letters such as ''C'' and ''G'' to increase its charm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Devroye|first1=Luc|title=Jonathan Hoefler|url=http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-27370.html|publisher=McGill University|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Italic type|Italics]] are true italic designs, with flourishes influenced by calligraphy, an unusual feature for geometric slab serif designs. As with many [[Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones]] designs, it was released in a wide range of weights from hairline to bold, reflecting its design goal as a typeface for complex magazines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Typographica review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Earls|first1=David John|title=Archer|url=http://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/archer/|website=Typographica|accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
The typeface has been used for, among other things, branding for [[Wells Fargo]] and is a main font for the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' and [[Wes Anderson]]'s film ''[[The Grand Budapest Hotel]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=Lauren|title=Is Archer's Use on Target?|url=http://www.aiga.org/is-archers-use-on-target/|publisher=AIGI}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the current font used for titles and body text by the [[Design Observer]] website.

===[[Katisha]]===
Contains no information not in [[The Mikado]] article, the point of the spin-off unclear, as the character only appears in one opera, and it's unclear how this could expand further. In normal circumstances I'd say merge or make it a redirect, but, as I said, everything IS covered in [[The Mikado]], and I can't imagine someone searching for &quot;Katisha&quot;.

*'''Delete''' article per nomination.  Anything notable about this character should appear in the plot summary of ''[[The Mikado]]''.  There is no reason to have a separate article for this character.  -- [[User:Ssilvers|Ssilvers]] 19:59, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Redirect''' it to [[The Mikado]] -- merge isn't needed since the info's there, but the redirect could be useful -- somebody could search for it. -- [[User:ArglebargleIV|ArglebargleIV]] 22:15, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

A tag has been placed on [[:Nonamaker]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article seems to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable [[Wikipedia:Notability|(see the guidelines for notability here)]]. If you can indicate why the subject of this article is notable, you may contest the tagging. To do this, please affix the template &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; to the page and leave a note on [[Talk:Nonamaker|the article's talk page]] explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself.

Please read the [[WP:CSD|criteria for speedy deletion]] (specifically, article #7) and [[Wikipedia:Notability (people)|our general biography criteria]].

== Waterboarding ==

Could you post a link where somebody calls [[surfing]] [[waterboarding]]?  I can't seem to find any. [[User:Jehochman|Jehochman]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Jehochman|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:46, 26 April 2009 (UTC)

Yes, Waterboarding is a very common term in Hawaii, the Western US, Australia and even some former Soviet countries. Here's a link to an article where the author references this http://mydailyclarity.com/2009/03/surfing-for-peace-in-the-gaza/. Also, I found a site that references waterboarding here http://www.hawaiiansouthshore.com/shop/product.php?productid=17375. It get's confusing; I was looking for 'surfing' but we call it Waterboarding so I got to the wrong page ;-)

: Fair enough.  That source uses &quot;water boarding&quot; with a space.  I've made a change to your edit to reflect the space. [[User:Jehochman|Jehochman]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Jehochman|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:23, 26 April 2009 (UTC)</text>

I removed &quot;2006 is only his second full season as a team-manager. It took other team managers, such as [[Frank Williams]] many years to win a grand prix as manager.&quot;

This suggests Fry is responsible for a dramatic turnaround in the team's performance - their 2005 and 2006 performances have been widely acknowledged to have been poor to middling. the circumstances of the Hungarian GP were also exceptional. [[User:Mark83|Mark83]] 19:37, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

::It has been reported in the Telegraph (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/motorsport/formulaone/5369856/Monaco-Grand-Prix-Jenson-Buttons-playboy-days-behind-him.html) that Nick Fry owns a proportion of the team, and in an earlier article, that he owns the majority stake. Shouldn't this be added?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/92.239.225.23|92.239.225.23]] ([[User talk:92.239.225.23|talk]]) 23:17, 28 May 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Klein-Glienicke Schweizerhaus 1.jpg|thumb|320px|''Schweizerhaus'' in [[Klein Glienicke]] near [[Berlin]], designed by [[Ferdinand von Arnim]], 1867]]
'''Swiss chalet style''' ({{lang-de|Schweizerstil}}, {{lang-no|Sveitserstil}}) is an [[architectural style]] of [[Historicism (art)|Late Historicism]], originally inspired by rural [[chalet]]s in [[Switzerland]] and the [[Alps|Alpine]] (mountainous) regions of [[Central Europe]]. The style refers to traditional building designs characterised by widely projecting roofs and facades richly decorated with wooden balconies and carved ornaments. It spread over [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Austria-Hungary]] and [[Scandinavia]] during the ''[[Belle Époque]]'' era.

==History==
[[File:Villa Fridheim, Krøderen, 2.jpg|thumb|Villa Fridheim in [[Krødsherad]], Norway]]
Swiss chalet style originated in the [[German Romanticism|Romantic]] era of the late-18th/early-19th century, when the ideas of the [[English landscape garden]] inspired parks and residences in Germany, such as the [[Dessau-Wörlitz Garden Realm]]. It became highly appreciated on the continent by noble landowners who were impressed by the &quot;simple life&quot; of people living in the mountains. 

The chalet style soon spread over the German ''[[Mittelgebirge]]'' landscapes such as the [[Harz]] mountains or the [[Dresden]] area and the adjacent [[North Bohemia]]n region. As a &quot;modern&quot; building style, it also influenced the [[resort architecture]] along the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] seaside, like in [[Binz]] or [[Heringsdorf, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|Heringsdorf]]. Around 1900, design elements were used in the construction of numerous bourgeois family homes as well as by notable architects like [[Heinrich von Ferstel]] to build larger mansions and hotels. 

The style was further popularized by the first waves of tourism of rich people from the North and West of Europe and became popular in other parts of Europe and North America, notably in the [[architecture of Norway]], [[architecture of Iceland|Iceland]] and [[Architecture of the Netherlands|the Netherlands]] and in the [[country house]] architecture of [[architecture of Sweden|Sweden]] and [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati (Ohio, USA)]], in the late 19th and early 20th century. English examples of the chalet style include the [[Boathouse at Belton House]], [[Lincolnshire]], by [[Anthony Salvin]] and the Swiss Cottage at [[Osbourne House]], on the [[Isle of Wight]], constructed for [[Queen Victoria]]'s children.

==Characteristics==
The style is characterized by:
*[[Gabled roof|Gabled roofs]] with wide [[eaves]]
*Exposed construction beams, including large [[Bracket (architecture)|brackets]]
*Decorative carving and mouldings
*[[Balconies]]
*Large windows
*[[Weatherboarding]], usually painted, often in bright colors

The result was '''delete'''. -- [[User:Jitse Niesen|Jitse Niesen]] ([[User talk:Jitse Niesen|talk]]) 12:28, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

:In case anybody requires an explanation how I arrived at this decision, as it is a bit borderline: There seems to be only one reliable source, an article repeated in USA Today and other media. What tipped the balance is firstly the weak reasons in some of the &quot;keep&quot; comments (specifically, those of necronudist, Portillo, and I don't understand Minfo); and secondly, I think we should be extremely cautious in having articles about living children. -- [[User:Jitse Niesen|Jitse Niesen]] ([[User talk:Jitse Niesen|talk]]) 12:45, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

* '''Delete''' - he's ten years old, for crying out loud. If he makes it as a pro then add him in but not until then. [[User:Qwghlm|Qwghlm]] 20:09, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
**'''Comment''' You can't delete or not delete an article purely based on age. --[[User:Pinkkeith|Pinkkeith]] 20:11, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
***'''Comment''' - the point is that he doesn't meet [[WP:BIO]]. There are thousands of kids with potential; they get articles here when that potential is realised by playing for the first team of a significant club. WP is not a crystal ball. [[User:BlueValour|BlueValour]] 20:53, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
****'''Comment''' Well, that wasn't the point that you made, but it does pass [[WP:BIO]] based on [[WP:GOOGLE]]. There is no crystal ball to this article at all, it is all based on present information and known fact. --[[User:Pinkkeith|Pinkkeith]] 21:00, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
*****'''Comment''' What &quot;known fact?&quot;  There is not a single source cited in the entire article.  I am particularly leery of this becoming another AFD where the article is kept because of references cited in the AFD discussion that never make it into the article thus defeating the entire purpose of this discussion and [[WP:V]].  --[[User:ElKevbo|ElKevbo]] 14:26, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
*We can, however, '''delete''' an article if no reliable sources are provided when challenged under [[WP:V|verifiability policy]].  Pinkkeith, can you point us to featured coverage in mainstream media?  Some of those are needed to let us keep the article.  Being signed to a youth team isn't notable enough to get thousands of other kids their own WP articles.  [[User:Barno|Barno]] 20:39, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
** Here is a [http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/technology/maney/2005-02-01-maney_x.htm USA Today article] on him. In there the writer mentions that he was covered in numerous other newspapers. --[[User:Pinkkeith|Pinkkeith]] 20:43, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
*** - fine but he has achieved nothing in the adult world - the press references are the result of a splendid publicity campaign for his video but that doesn't confer notability. [[User:BlueValour|BlueValour]] 20:57, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
**** That's blatent [[ephebiphobia]]. Reread the article, the entire article is talking about the video and how it made him notable. --[[User:Pinkkeith|Pinkkeith]] 21:01, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

[http://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=%22Jean+Carlos+Chera%22&amp;btnG=Search+Archives&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8 Google News Archive] search yields 74 unique hits- more than enough to qualify as &quot;the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person.&quot; How old the subject is and the method in which he was made notable isn't relevant; the subject meets [[WP:BIO]]. --[[User talk:Rory096|Rory096]] 21:14, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
:*'''Comment''' - most of the content, apart from his birthdate, fails [[WP:V]]. The Ghits mean we can keep the article not that we must. They are all the result of a single video being published on the internet and they have all picked up the same story.

[[User:BlueValour|BlueValour]] 16:58, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''-So he's a child prodigy, that doesn't make him notable.  Some of my friends are amazing at basketball, but they don't have any articles.  As above, if he makes it to the pros (or college, if Brazil has a college league, I dunno), then we can always repost.

*'''Delete'''  When he has played for Manchester United, Arsenal, Porto, Eindhoven or Real Madrid he will have earned his article.  Until then it is worth remembering that, at least in the UK, it would be highly improper for professional clubs to express an interest in a 10 year old, let alone to 'openly court' them.

*'''Delete''' I've reviewed some of these news articles. I can read only the English ones, which are basically the same novelty one-shot story, repeated, or something like the USA today story, which is more about how everyone is famous on the Internet than a biographical source for an article.

Many of the users are very bias against the idea of a 7yr old having its own article or the fact that his only a child prodigy, but indeed we have a child prodigy article. Im definately getting a sense of outright bias and a feeling that many of the voters here are americans. [[portillo]]

*'''Comment''' - I think most of the delete (and some of the keep) votes are completely missing the point. Of course this kid isn't a notable footballer. He is however notable as an internet/media phenomenon. Wikipedia has plenty of articles for such people, as an example go look at [[Mahir Çağrı]]. Then at the bottom of his page have a look at the categories he's placed in. When someone comes to Wikipedia and searches for &quot;that kid i saw clips of on TV&quot; or &quot;that kid my mate sent me videos of&quot; and who's name give 35,000 google hits... He should be here! [[User:Alii h|aLii]] 15:20, 6 November 2006 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' per norm. [[User:Minfo|м info]] 23:03, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - I wonder if there is a misunderstanding here? If you are a child prodigy as a piano player you can play the piano. If you are a child prodigy as a mathematician you can do complicated sums in your head. Here, the kid undoubtedly has unusual ball skills but that doesn't make him a footballer. I also don't see him as a 'internet/media phenomenon' with any longevity - with YouTube such phenonima come and go like snow in the sun. [[User:TerriersFan|TerriersFan]] 00:01, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
:He was born as a YouTube phenomen but now he's known by all of the users above, has google entries and BBC articles. Guys, you wanna delete him, let's do it. Simply there are people who search for him and people who know him, there are many articles on paper magazines about him, but if you are too zealous to keep a 9-years-old top-youngster 'cause &quot;well, dear Watson, it fails WP:BIO =_= ahem&quot; let's do it. Do it and stop arguing bullshits. --[[User:Necronudist|necronudist]] 09:24, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

The '''European Federation of [[Financial Analyst]]s Societies''' ('''EFFAS''')[http://www.effas.com] is the federation of [[financial analyst|analysts]] associations in Europe. EFFAS comprises 27 member societies representing more than 14,000 investment professionals. EFFAS was founded in 1962 and the headquarters is located in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]].

Besides its European training programme CEFA (Certified European Financial Analyst) EFFAS also grants the Certified International Investment Analysts (CIIA) designation, ensuring professional qualification by offering global as well as local market knowledge within its examination structure. As a global designation the exams can be taken in different languages. Through the national member societies EFFAS provides a full range of services for capital market experts.

==CIIA Certification==
EFFAS participates in further developing the [[Certified International Investment Analyst]] (CIIA) examinations, a financial analyst designation recognised globally. Analysts who belong to European analyst associations that are members of EFFAS, are eligible to participate in the final CIIA examination, if they pass the foundation and the national exams, or if they hold the Certified European Financial Analyst diploma (CEFA).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Big Andy, (Andrew Walsh) was born in Louisville, Ky., on Feb. 12, 1978.  His father, Frank Walsh and mother, Marsha Sils were overly delighted to have him, since their first son, Patrick, was a dud.  Big Andy was known through his childhood as being pretty funny.  His brother, not so much.  His parents divorced in 1981, after his father recuperated from emergency brain surgery, after falling through the roof at his work and landing head first on the concrete below.  He continued to work there until he passed away after a 3 year battle with melanoma, in 2006, a week before his 54th birthday.  His mom remarried and had another child, a daughter named Brittani (Gamble).</text>

{{Wikipedia subcat guideline|notability criteria|{{PAGENAME}}|[[WP:NMS]]&lt;br&gt;[[WP:SCIENCE]]}}
--&gt;
{{rejected}}

Ideas related to science are an important part of any comprehensive [[WP:ENC|encyclopedia]].  This guideline and its criteria are intended for use in determining whether a topic is notable due to being a part of or related to science.  The tests in this guideline are intended to be fairly rigirous so that a topic that is acceptable under this guideline can be considered an appropriate part of Wikipedia.  However, the failure of a topic to meet this guideline's criteria does not automatically exclude it, as it may attain notability through [[WP:N]] itself or another of its subsidiary guidelines.

==Notability of topics related to science==

The need for this guideline comes from there being a set of topics which do not fail the test of the [[Wikipedia:No original research|No original research]] policy or the [[Wikipedia:Attribution]] policy but which none the less are not appropriate to Wikipedia because they do have sufficient notability.  Such topics mostly represent new findings and theories, as well as past findings and theories that have failed to gain significant attention in either scientific circles or the public at large (or so far failed to gain said attention).

A key element to understanding this guideline is that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a research publication, and as such Wikipedia does not usurp the usual validation processes of scientific institutions such as [[peer review]], [[scientific consensus]], and academic recognition. Decisions about including or excluding material must always reflect the opinions of outside authorities, not those of Wikipedia editors. Inclusion or exclusion is therefore not a judgement on the validity, importance or accuracy of a scientific contribution, but simply a reflection of the quality and quantity of responses it received inside and outside the [[scientific community]].

This [[WP:N|notability guideline]] derives its relevance from the policies [[WP:NOT|What Wikipedia is not]] (in particular [[WP:NOT#IINFO|Not an indiscriminate collection of information]] and [[WP:NOT#CRYSTALBALL|Not a crystal ball]]), [[WP:NOR|No original research]] and [[WP:NPOV|Neutral point of view]] (in particular [[WP:NPOV#Undue weight|Undue weight]] and [[Wikipedia:Neutral point  of view/FAQ#Pseudoscience|Pseudoscience]]), as well as the guidelines [[Wikipedia:Conflict of interest|Conflict of interest]] and [[WP:AUTO|Autobiography]]. Also of importance are [[WP:V|verifiability]] and [[WP:RS|reliability]] policies.

==Criteria==
=== General ===
In general, a contribution in the field of science is notable enough to merit inclusion in Wikipedia if it meets at least one of the following criteria:

#'''Textbook science.''' There is regular non-incidental mention of the contribution in general or specialized textbooks published by reputable presses.{{ref|1|1}}
#'''Widely cited.''' Papers covering the contribution have been widely cited{{ref|2|2}} in its research field{{ref|3|3}} relative to other papers in the same area. Self-citations, and citations in journals which are not respected within the relevant research field should be excluded.
#'''Press and fiction.''' It is or was well known due to extensive press coverage, or due to being a recurrent theme in notable works of [[fiction]]. In this case the article should make note of this status. A single article on the theory, even if from a major media source such as ''[[New Scientist]]'' or ''[[Scientific American]]'', is not a sufficient criterion.
#'''Historical interest.''' It has historically met any of the above criteria within the scientific community or the culture at large but has since either been [[superseded scientific theory|superseded]], disregarded, or dismissed by the scientific community or the culture at large. The article should make note of the subject's status in this regard.
#'''Popular belief.''' It is or was believed to be true by a significant part of the general population, even if rejected by scientific authorities.

Notable topics which are primarily non-scientific in nature but which contain claims concerning scientific phenomena, should not be handled as scientific.  For example, the ''[[Book of Genesis]]'' itself is primarily covered as a religious scripture rather than as a cosmology. On the other hand, subjects such as [[creationism]] or [[creation science]], which involve a direct conflict between scientific and religious doctrine, are properly evaluated both on a scientific and theological basis. Similarly, subjects purporting to have a scientific basis may be noteworthy primarily on cultural or sociological bases, such as UFOs, which can usefully be discussed from several different perspectives.

:{{Seealso|Wikipedia:Notability (science)/Irrelevant arguments}}

===Scientific terms===
:''See also [[Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms]]
A scientific term is considered notable and worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia if the following can be established:
# A commonly agreed-upon formal or informal definition
# A trajectory of use for the term in the scientific literature from [[WP:RS|reliable]] and [[WP:V|verifiable]] sources
To determine notability it is important to keep in mind that different fields sometimes use the same term to describe different concepts. On the other hand, especially in the early stages of a field, terminology is often not standardized and different terms are used for the same concept. The policy on [[WP:NAME|naming conventions]] gives more information on the choice of the proper term when more than one term is used in the scientific literature.

== Assessing the reliability and relevance of sources ==

Journals from which citations and evidence of notability are obtained are expected to be well known and respected within the relevant research field.  The previous requirement of citation from a peer-reviewed source is not alone sufficient by this requirement.  (Peer review is done just as easily by a fringe science journal as by a leading journal, while [[Nature (journal)|Nature magazine]], one of the most respected [[scientific journals]] in existence, uses editorial as well as  peer review for submissions.)

Textbooks should either be well-known and respected or produced by a reputable scientific publisher (which is most likely the same publisher as one or more respected journals).

Journals from scientific societies of developing countries are occasionally not reliable.  If a finding in such a journal should prove to be of great scientific interest, that finding is often reprinted and/or reported in reliable scientific sources.  In such a case, the original journal article can be cited as a primary source, but its relevance should be backed up by secondary citations in known reliable sources.

For biographical articles and articles on fringe science, there is some loosening of these requirements.  Works by the topic of a biographical article are relevant to the article whether their writing was published in a reliable journal/publisher or not.  Also, the contents of a journal devoted to a fringe science can provide evidence as to the past or current thinking within that fringe field.  However, the fringe science journals cannot provide evidence for the outright notability of the topic.

==Notes==
{{note|1|Note 1}}:  The scientific contribution must have a major entry in the work. A passing mention of the concept is not sufficient. 

{{note|2|Note 2}}:  Citation counts and peer review mechanisms differ vastly between sciences, fields, and subfields, and editors are urged to inform the relevant [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Council/Directory/Science|WikiProject]] about ongoing debates to get expert input. It should also be noted that ''quantity'' of citations is often only a poor approximation of ''quality''.

{{note|3|Note 3}}:  A &quot;research field&quot; indicates an established area of study for which the topic in question is only a part.  A topic cannot be its own research field, nor can it gain notability from being part of a field which is non-notable.

__NOTOC__
===Overview===
After much deliberation of the [[Wikipedia:Danny's contest/Contest entries|contest entries]] the judges have arrived at a decision.

The entries could be broken down into three broad groups... entries that didn't seem to have much, if any, improvement, entries that were a &quot;good try&quot; and a handful of entries that really took the contest to heart and added a lot of interesting and germane references.

===Criteria===
The judges graded on 4 major criteria:
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!Criterion
!Description
!Weight
|-
|'''Number of citations'''
|Just a  raw count of how many were added. This was a good filter to see if the article could make the finalists... only 2 or 3 refs suggested that maybe not so much had been done.  
|(20%)
|-
|'''Complexity of citations'''
|A gauge of the difficulty level of adding them. Were they notes? web cites? book cites? did they use ISBN tagging? were there multiple places that got the same note? Notes ON notes? 
|(30%)
|-
|'''Appropriateness of cites'''
|Were they actually GOOD cites that moved the article forward?
|(20%)  
|-
|'''Overall article improvement'''

|'''[[Battle of Ceresole]]'''
|An important battle in medieval history, part of the [[Italian Wars]] series. Characterised by contemporaries as &quot;marvellously confused&quot; this battle is attractively illustrated with lots of maps and diagrams. One would expect Kyrill as coordinator of [[WP:MILHIST]] to do a good job of improving an article, and Kyrill does not disappoint. A very powerful article about an interesting battle.

|'''[[Theramenes]]'''
|An important general and historical figure of ancient Greece, including participating in an Athenian coup, multiple battles, and a rebellion. He even had notoriety after death. The article is challenging due to a paucity of sources, but Robth found 80+ cites. There also is an innovative organisation of sources into modern and ancient. A very good article based on some painstaking research.

|'''[[Crawford expedition]]'''
|A very understudied but important battle in the [[American Revolution]]. The winning side often tends to ignore battles they lost, and this article was not much more than a single paragraph stub when Kevin went to town on it. It is now profusely illustrated with maps, paintings, tables and diagrams and has grown to 43 Kb. In addition to 88 high quality footnotes, it also has a comprehensive &quot;references&quot; and &quot;for further reading&quot; section, properly separated out. All books have good ISBN links. This article is a real tour de force and shows the power of our encyclopedia well.

That all of these articles were somehow military related was surely coincidence! :)

'''Joe Eubanks''' (born 1975) is an [[United States|American]] [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] best known by the [[ring name]] '''Lobo'''. He wrestled primarily in [[Combat Zone Wrestling]] (CZW), where he won every major championship and was the first inductee into the [[CZW Hall of Fame]] in 2004. He was formerly the CZW Commissioner/Talent Coordinator.&lt;ref name=&quot;Online World of Wrestling&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/040207.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling 5th Anniversary Show February 7, 2004 - Philadelphia, Pennsylvania - ECW Arena|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===1999-2002===
Along with [[Nick Gage]], [[Justice Pain]], and [[Ric Blade]], Lobo was trained by [[John Zandig]] at the CZW Wrestling School and graduated first in the class.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freewebs.com/andy_czw1/history.html CZWHookup : The history of CZW] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210134119/http://www.freewebs.com/andy_czw1/history.html |date=2008-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He became one of the main wrestlers in CZW along with other graduates from the school. In February 1999, Lobo became the second [[CZW Iron Man Championship|Iron Man Champion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Online World of Wrestling&quot;/&gt; He held the title until June when he lost it to Justice Pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/990619.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling - CZW Down in Flames June 19, 1999 - Mantua, NJ |accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two continued wrestling each other and competed in the first ever Cage of Death match at the first ''Cage of Death'' show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/991016.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling - CZW Cage of Death October 16, 1999 - Mantua, NJ|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lobo won the match and regained the title. He would lose this title to [[Matt Prince|Wifebeater]], but regain it one more time the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/000311.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling - CZW March Violence March 11, 2000 - Sewell, NJ|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lobo also challenged for the [[CZW World Heavyweight Championship|CZW Heavyweight Championship]]. He feuded with Zandig for the title and finally beat him in July 2000. He held the title until ''Cage of Death II''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/000909.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling - CZW Cage of Death II....After Dark September 9, 2000 - Sewell, NJ|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that show, Lobo successfully defended the championship against Zandig in the Cage of Death match. Directly following this match, Justice Pain came out and fought Lobo in another Cage of Death match. In the match, Lobo was thrown from the top of the cage to the ground through a table covered in barbed wire. Justice Pain went on to win the match and the title.&lt;ref name=&quot;Online World of Wrestling&quot;/&gt;  After losing the title, Lobo continued feuding with Zandig. This time, the feud was for ownership of CZW. On February 9, 2002, Lobo defeated Zandig to become the new owner of CZW. He held this position until ''Cage of Death IV'' when Zandig defeated him to regain his position as CZW's owner &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/021213.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling December 13, 2002 - Philadelphia, PA - Viking Hall|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2003-present===
He took some time off from CZW following the Cage of Death match. While he was gone, a new group called the Hi-V tried to take over CZW, with Zandig as their main target. Zandig was planning to face the Hi-V at ''Cage of Death V'', but the stable outnumbered his team 6 to 4. At ''Night of Infamy II'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/031115.html|title=Night of Infamy II - November 15, 2003 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lobo made a shocking return to help Zandig and join his team just in time for Cage of Death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/031213.html|title=Cage of Death V December 13, 2003 - Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their team was successful. In February 2004, Lobo became the first inductee to the CZW Hall of Fame. After this, Lobo remained inactive for the following two years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Online World of Wrestling&quot;/&gt;

At [[Cage of Death 7]], [[Zandig]], who had turned on the fans, wanted to run CZW the way they used to. He called out Lobo, who was backstage for the event, and they joined each other along with [[Justice Pain]] and [[Nick Gage]]. They would later call themselves the Forefathers of CZW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/_2006/|title=2006 results

*'''Speedy Delete''' - for blatant advertising.  I waited a bit to see how this one would play out before making a decision, but as much good faith as I normally assume, there is no sticking up for this one.  The article's [[User:Kobius|prime editor]] (and incidentally, the forum admin) removed the AfD tag from the page and does not take kindly to other editors touching 'his' page.  The whole layout of the article is clearly trying to draw viewers into the forums, perhaps to meet the admitted goal of 500,000 posts.  Add these to the issues others have pointed out and there's really no need for further discussion.

The Anizone is a large site and I think if someone wants to find out more about it they come to the best internet dictionary in the world and they research on of the largest best sites. The site has a largely amount of fair people considering it has been hacked three times. The admin accidently remoe it thinking it would be delete and he was not the maker of the page but it was I.

==BBC News Report and the pilot &quot;looking for a good place to crash&quot;==

The BBC article states that the pilot was looking for a good place to put the aircraft down; he missed some park and instead put the aircraft down in an uninhabited area near Stockport city centre. The evidence does not justify this supposition whatsoever. For one thing, the AIB report states that the aircraft was likely uncontrollable after the engines cut out, and might not have been controllable even before then. The first officer died and the captain suffered retrograde amnesia, so we don't know what went on in the cockpit. There isn't the tiniest shred of evidence that the pilot &quot;put the aircraft down&quot; someplace safe. It was likely just coincidence - there are a lot of empty or disused areas around airports and under approach paths (and *that* is often deliberate).

This is such a common urban legend/media foofah. Every time a plane doesn't actually fall out of the sky, some media type comes up and says the pilot was &quot;looking for a place to crash that wouldn't cause injuries on the ground&quot;. I don't blame the Wikipedian who put this in at all, because he/she likely didn't have any sources other than the BBC article. I am blaming the BBC for making a supposition not supported by the facts.

I suppose people want to think that in an emergency the first thing the pilot will do is look for a safe place to crash. It makes them feel less worried about an aircraft crashing into their home, school, or place of business. It ain't necessarily so, though; in fact it almost is never so. Aircraft about to crash are more often than not uncontrollable - that's why they crash. --[[User:Charlene.fic|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot; face=&quot;Matisse ITC&quot;&gt;Charlene&lt;/font&gt;]] 19:40, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

Edited to add: The cause of the accident wasn't &quot;pump failure&quot; (boo, BBC, again). It was a design error in the fuel line. --[[User:Charlene.fic|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot; face=&quot;Matisse ITC&quot;&gt;Charlene&lt;/font&gt;]] 20:02, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

:Apologies. That would have been my factual faux pas. Thank you for correcting my blathering and making this article respectable. :) [[User:Legion89|Legion]] 13:56, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

A second's more flight and the plane would catastrophically have taken the tower off Stockport's fine Town Hall and crashed into the facade of the (then) infirmary opposite the Town Hall, blocking the main road between that runs from Manchester through Stockport to the south - AG, Stockport.

== Additional cause of this crash ==

I remember seeing a BBC program about this crash. It reported on the findings of the inquiry. It said that there was an additional reason for the crash.

Apparently, the engine speeds were shown in the cockpit on two dials, one for each wing. Each dial had two hands, one for each engine and each labelled with the engine number.

This had been serviced, and a mistake had been made so that engine 3 was connected to the hand marked &quot;4&quot;, and engine 4 to hand &quot;3&quot;.

I think it was engine 4 that was starved of fuel. The pilot saw from the dial that engine 3 had stopped, so he switched off / feathered engine 3. Now both engines on the right wing were out. (This would explain why engine 4 was windmilling.)

As part of the investigation, they tried flying a similar aircraft with engines 3 and 4 both out, and discovered that the aircraft could not be flown properly.

Now, I mention all this because it is an interesting story. Also, because I want to apply the moral to setting up a computer cluster. I want to avoid the possibility of one computer failing and a different one being taken out for service by mistake, thereby bringing down the cluster. 

Does anyone know more about this? [[User:Mm67|Mm67]] 11:44, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

==Is [[Wikipedia:Notability (science)]] a consensus guideline?==
Please state your position, '''yes''' or '''no''', explain your position and defend it.  This is not a vote.  [[User:SmokeyJoe|SmokeyJoe]] 10:47, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Yes''' I consider it one, and I'm not sure what objection people have - if there's a problem that needs fixing, let's fix it.  I already refer to it, guideline or not, since it's very useful.  --[[User:Minderbinder|Minderbinder]] 12:38, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Yes''' Not only is it a consensus guideline, it is absolutely vital for Wikipedia to have such a guideline. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 12:51, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Yes''' I certainly support this guideline, what it is trying to do, and how it is trying to achieve it. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:10, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Yes''' We're ready to go into the stage where changes should be discussed here before being implemented in the policy page. ~ [[User:Trialsanderrors|trialsanderrors]] 17:40, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Absolutely''' We've numerous AfDs and arbcom cases which have documented that this is the community's intent. --[[User:EngineerScotty|EngineerScotty]] 17:44, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* I don't see where the proposed criteria add meaningful advice to writters or evaluators, and the preamble/text is way too long to be practical.  Please cite some examples of AfD where this proposal would have ensured an outcome other than what would have been achieved under the current guidelines.  For each of the criteria now listed I belive that proper application of WP:N and WP:ATT would acheive the same results.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 17:54, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
** There is [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Electric universe (concept)]], where this standard helped to refine the arguments that finally got the topic removed.  The aupporters trying to use this guideline to buoy their cause ended up only showing all the more that the article did not belong in Wikipedia.  &lt;br&gt;You are correct that in the end articles that are removed will be so removed (or not) due to policy concerns.  The need for this guideline comes from its ability to focus the debate on the issues that are important in the relevant cases.  In other words, it helps to achieve the &quot;proper application&quot; that you are claiming makes this guideline irrelevant. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 18:22, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
*** EMS, could your purpose be acheived with an essay?  Among the problems with permutations from guidelines and policies is the evolution into redundant and conficting guidance to the point that writers and evaluators become confused and the branches work at cross purposes.  My frequent analogy is the US Tax Code, which has bread several large industries for interpretation and application.  Writing complex rule sets requires great skill and caution. --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 18:34, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
*** On review of the Electric universe (concept) AfD, it appears to be resoundingly rejected with the tools we already have, most convincingly original research and few reliable sources.  This outcome is consistent with other scientific and academic issues which I have seen defeated at AfD. An excellent nomination doesn't hurt either! --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 18:42, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
**** Right now I am wondering what your agenda is here, as this type of opposition usually comes from someone who has lost an AfD in part due to this and the guidelines and is seeking to water down the standards.  One of the factors that helped with the electric universe AfD was the the nominator was also working on this guideline and used its insights in writing the nom.  Beyond that, there is the basic issue of moving beyond &quot;peer review&quot; as a standard for inclusion, a test passed by numerous non-notable articles that I have seen.  Also, I at least have gone to some pains to couch this as a setting standard for inclusions instead of exclusion.  That way, an argument that &quot;X calls for inclusion&quot; renders this guideline moot as a refutation, and so avoids the types of conflicts that in our laws make being a lawyer such a profitable profession. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 19:16, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
***** My agenda is not as you assert, but your question is a fair one, which I will answer.  My agenda is clarity in the grand scheme of notability guidelines, without a specific prejudice to this proposal. Please visit the discussion page for WP:N to see that there are many people expressing concerns over the whole process.  I support the concept of &quot;encyclopedic suitability&quot;, which we call notablility at WP, for lack of a better name.  I also consider myself a moderate inclusionist.  I am a frequent participant in Afd.  You are correct in one respect, that I origninally became involved in AfD and notability, because I saw too many abuses by uninformed editors who were deleting meanigful articles, though not specifically in the field of science.  My interest is in history and sailing.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 19:33, 16 March 2007 (UTC) 
******Might I recommend that your &quot;no&quot; comment seems to be motivated more by a general dislike for [[WP:N]] rather than a specific distaste for this particular guideline. In particular, the motivation behind this guideline was in part due to a charge made during the [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Pseudoscience|Pseudoscience arbitrartion case]] that such a guideline should exist to fend off charges related to whether an idea was notable in a scientific sense. One can argue whether [[WP:N]] should exist or not, but that's not for us to decide here. It is absolutely not true that this guideline is redudant: there is no other place where it is indicated what makes a scientific idea notable for inclusion in the encyclopedia. [[WP:NOR]] doesn't help because &quot;originality&quot; is a vague concept related to heavily to [[WP:V]] and [[WP:COI]] to be useful when people just make random articles about ostensibly scientific subjects they read about online, for example. [[WP:A]] doesn't help because there are scientific ideas which are not notable (the general consensus of the community is that they do not belong in the encyclopedia) which nevertheless are attributable to reliable sources. [[WP:NPOV]] doesn't work because the exclusion criteria at [[WP:NPOV#Undue weight]] is unable to distinguish between majority and minority except by [[WP:CON|consensus]]. That's why this guideline is needed and why it is used. Look at all the pages that link here and tell me that it isn't referred to. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 13:09, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
* No, it's not.  I think the burden of some evidence that this guideline is widely supported and necessary needs to be shown from the supporters.  Right now it's an initiative, a proposal with stable wording.  However, even in the &quot;test cases&quot; that I looked at, it seems that this guideline isn't being referred to, and evaluation of the articles in question isn't done with these guidelines in mind, rather, articles are mainly evaluated from a point of view of adequate sourcing and original research issues, in other words, policies we already have.  (I do think the editors here have reached a reasonably stable consensus, though.  But that doesn't, to me, make a &quot;consensus guideline,&quot; which implies support from the community overall.)[[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:04, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
**The evidence is in the ''What links here'' tool you can access from the toolbox. I think that you may have a hidden agenda here: you tend to be a bit too quick to agree to a supression bias against non-experts in the fields of science. Is this a misplaced concern? --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 13:09, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
***First of all there are over 150 things that link to [[Wikipedia:Notability (science)]], so it's not unreasonable to expect evidence to be actually gathered by someone trying to make a case.  But more, I went to a few of those &quot;what links here&quot; and apparently the only reason they were linked was that trialsanderrors mentioned that the debate was a test case: not people actually referring to the guideline and trying to use it.  Look at the Electric Universe AfD, for instance, which is the best example I've seen of a borderline-notable scientific theory (where this guideline might help).  [[WP:SCIENCE]] was not used as an argument in the debate, even by you, and the arguments that led to it being deleted were not even much along the lines of what is presented here in the guideline, but were according to core Wikipedia policies like [[WP:ATT]], [[WP:OR]] and so on.  Some of the argument is covered here in the introduction, but the &quot;criteria&quot; part played no role and seems to be central to this as a notability guideline.  So, this is what I mean when I say that no evidence has been presented.  What do YOU mean when you say this is a consensus guideline?  [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:43, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
****The criteria part played a huge role. The only criteria that EU could have come close to satisfying was recognition in popular culture/outside media and we showed that it was not notable along those lines. The guidelines at the time were being formulated and weren't as clear as they are now, but thanks to discussions such as that AfD we have a clearer demarcation. I think you need to read through the AfD we reference again and look carefully at how the criteria line-up with the criteria outlined in this guideline. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:02, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
*****Could you show me precisely where?  I don't mean to be dense, but I really don't see it.  I see your point #5 in the nomination, but that sounds like the core [[WP:N]] argument, and not related to the criteria here.  And anyway, saying the the EU debate influenced [[WP:SCIENCE]] kind of precludes that the EU debate can be thought of as evidence that this is a consensus guideline.  Can you show me ANY AfD debate that explicitly references the criteria?  [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:17, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
******Number 5 in the nomination. While it doesn't explicitly reference this page, it does so implicitly (and if I recall correctly at the time the standards were still being developed as to which criteria were going to be grouped with which). --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:20, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
*******Again, #5 was really along the lines of basic [[WP:N]].  Again, show me any debates that explicitly reference the criteria.  There's a difference between this proposal being wise or balanced or sensible and it having ''broad community support.''  [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:44, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
********Basic [[WP:N]]&quot;? That's a bit of WikiLawyering I haven't come across before. The fact is that #5 has direct parallels to our criteria here. You can thrust your head in the sand over this all you want, but that's the plain truth of the matter. And now you reposition your attack to claim that there isn't &quot;broad community support&quot;, but let me remind you that arbcomm members entreatied the community to develop these standards in the first place and that by virtue of this being a Wiki it will end up as balanced and sensible as possible. I'm beginning to think you are being a stick-in-the-mud for reasons you aren't coming clean about. Help me out, explain to me why you always seem to be fighting against scientific accuracy at Wikipedia so I can [[WP:AGF|assume good faith]] towards your contributions. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 17:36, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
***I suggest you go read [[WP:AGF]] and actually take it to heart.  In our current discussion, you seem to have trouble differentiating between (1) my personal support or opposition of the proposal and (2) my arguing that the proposal isn't a &quot;consensus guideline&quot;, that is, that it doesn't have broad support.  This wouldn't be a very hard difference to understand if you had been assuming good faith of me in the first place.  For the record, I support some of what the proposal says but not all of it, but that wasn't the basis for my objections: calling the proposal a &quot;consensus guideline&quot; is wrong, because this is still a very new proposal, barely even stable enough to judge.  [[WP:PROF]] remained a proposal for a very long time, and finally became a guideline when it became apparent that the guideline had influenced the way decisions were being made, and that the community, de facto, embraced the guideline.  Creation of policies and guidelines is slow and for good reason, especially when actionable changes are being proposed (like the criteria here).

****I appreciate your candor regarding your opinions of the content of this guideline because that is precisely what concerns me. However, I do feel that you are being a bit oblique in your commentary. &quot;Policy creation is slow,&quot; is often the cry of those who want to slow things down, and people tend to drag their feet for a reason. To me and many of the other editors who commented above, this guideline is ''de facto'' in place and isn't a proposal because we as editors abide by it. As you know, Wikipedia policies and guidelines are not written to affect change in the encyclopedia, but rather are meant to describe what actively goes on in editing. A good number of those who say that this is a consensus guideline edit a lot of science-related articles and so should be the ones to tell whether or not this guideline applies. I don't see that you are actively doing this as such. I do see you stepping into disputes regarding science-related articles often, and there are many times I see these actions as being in something of a contravention of the guidelines outlined here. I am being very up-front about my distrust of your motivations, but in so doing I'm also trying to assume good-faith as much as I can. Part of assuming good-faith is being transparent about one's perceptions and I'm offering you the opportunity to explain yourself as transparently as possible so we can move on. I don't like being lectured about [[WP:AGF]] when I was the one who brought it up, it looks to me like you are asking me to turn a blind eye towards our long history here at the encyclopedia and I am honestly telling you I'm having a hard time doing it because of the nature of this particular dispute we're having. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 13:53, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
*****You are making false implications about me, and I want it to stop.  [[WP:CIV|Comment on my comments]].  You say this is an attempt to document how Wikipedia works?  I respectfully disagree -- this talk page and its archives are full of debates about what the criteria ''should'' be, with very little discussion or analysis of how things are actually decided now.  (Some, but not much.)  From perusing the test cases, it seems to me that people are nearly exclusively deciding on these cases on the basis of [[WP:OR]], [[WP:ATT]], and [[WP:NPOV]], (and to a degree, [[WP:N]]), without much need for arguments specific to issue that the topics under discussion are scientific ones.  Since that ''isn't'' the content of this proposal, I cannot agree that this is documenting current Wikipedia practice, but if you want to try to change my mind, please show me specific examples so we can discuss them.  In any case, you should advertise this debate on [[WP:VPR]]; the general Wikipedia community should have a chance to comment.

******Whether they are false or not, they are simply my questions regarding your, frankly, obstinate resistance to this particular document. I am trying to be as forthright as possible here, and your increasingly haughty responses only confuse me further since you still haven't addressed directly my concerns regarding the history we have surrounding issues such as this. I disagree that the discussions are centering around how things &quot;should&quot; be. Rather I see discussions centering around generalizing from the experience that editors have. You also seem to be under the opinion that just because people reference older and more established policies and guidelines they aren't also considering this guideline. This I find to be particularly problematic because it ignores the words of people that aren't appended with a WP-acronym. Just because somebody doesn't cite this directly doesn't mean that you can't see the criteria being applied (as per our earlier discussion on EU deletion). I would hope that you would look more closely at the deletion discussions surrounding this and see if you can't spot the criteria in action. I am not going to advertise the debate anywhere, but you are free to do so. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 16:27, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
*******I've advertised the debate at [[WP:VPR]].  In terms of the status: you see one thing, I see another thing.  I'm not going to change my opinion by simply being told &quot;please look more closely,&quot; although you could convince me if you actually showed me some evidence.  I do see a lot of attempts at guiding the community: take a look at [[#&quot;Conference topic&quot; is a backdoor]], for instance, or [[#One final thought]]: people are discussing how to make a good rule, not what the rule is, organically.

****I'm with SA here: [[WP:N]] is being criticized partly because of its extreme generality.  No reason to think the entire idea of notability for all topics must pause just because of that.

****  The problem lies less with any individual sub-guideline, but more with a plethora of permutations leading to confusion.

***** I don't see any bedlam here.  I see this as being a well crafted guideline that is dealing with issues which are out-of-scope for the more general guideline due to its broad nature.  This guideline deals with the issues of science and science-related topics, and how to implement the notability guidelines within that context.&lt;br&gt;I have looked at the [[WP:N]] discussion and I get the feeling that you are doing your best to create uncertainty and confusion there.  And now you are trying to do the same here.  I for one have no need for it, and support this guideline as a reflection of the legitimate sense of the science editors here as to what is valid. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 18:23, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
*Yes, this appears to be a consensus guideline. The opposition to this guideline proposal may be part of a campaign in which User:Kevin Murray in the past month has placed &quot;rejected&quot; , &quot;disputed&quot; , or &quot;historical&quot; , or &quot;essay&quot; labels on about a dozen notability proposals or guidelines or has nominated them for deletion on the grounds that there was no consensus or that they constituted &quot;instruction creep&quot; or were redundant. A proposal is not necessarily impossible to reach consensus upon just because a few editors oppose it.

** I see your point.  This editor really, really has a grudge against the concept of notability, and I would love to know why.  If you want to do a [[WP:RfC]] against him, I am will be happy to second it.  This is ridiculous. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 19:42, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
*** No EMS, this editor, has a &quot;grudge&quot; against needless and redundant rule making for the sake of rule making.  I strongly support the concept of encyclopedic suitability which we call &quot;notability&quot; at WP.  This is not &quot;ridiculous&quot; but based on observations from life experience, that too many conficting rules create confusion rather than clarity.  Complex rule-sets require incredible cross coordination among the permutations, which is not happening here at WP, as guidelines are multiplying like rabbits without consideration of the big picture.  If you propose an RfC, please do so in the best interest of WP, not &quot;against&quot; me; this is not personal and reviewing the discussions will reveal that my actions are well supported.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 14:18, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
****There are plenty of Wikipedians who [[WP:IAR|agree with you about hating rules]]. However, might I suggest that you are going about it the wrong way. We are here writing this guideline because we need to summarize what has been done in regards to this issue. Your own personal distaste for the way in which editors have gone about doing this is probably best argued elsewhere: it certainly has nothing to do with whether consensus exists for this particular guideline. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:29, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
*** I do not see '''any''' need to coordinate this guideline with any other guidelines beside [[WP:N]] itself.  Although I am doing my own &quot;[[WP:NOR|original research]]&quot;, I have seem enough -uh- &quot;stuff&quot; offered by others such that I see a need to draw a firm and reasonable as to what is and is not acceptable here.  Until it has some reasonable amount of recognition in the scientific community, I see an article on my ideas as being an abuse of Wikipedia.  Yet I am unusual in that most other editors of Wikipedia with alternate ideas are here to promote those ideas, and they hate guidelines like this one with a purple passion because they help to keep their OR out.&lt;br&gt;BTW - I do see where you have had some success with you anti-Notability campaign.  Personally I think that you are doing Wikipedia a real disservice with it, and what you are stifling is not a bunch useless rule-making but instead needed elaborations on the meaning of Notability in various domains.  As has been noted in [[Wikipedia_talk:Notability|the WP:N discussion]], there is a level of subjectiveness in determining notability.  The need for these subsidary guidelines is to limit that subjectiveness, and thereby make this concept more usable.  Instead you are trying to pull the rug out from under Notability, something that will make the removal of questionable material much more difficult than it should be. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 16:08, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''the real test''' is whether the guidelines here will be accepted in practice. Both the above positions are to some degree correct: the guideline should reflect what its eds. believe to be the common feeling of the community, but it shouldalso point in the direction of where the consensus appears to be moving, and to be making recommendations from those most involved in edited these articles to guide thos less familiar. I think it will prove to be accepted because it is relatively straightforward, not complex -- at least by comparison -- and, in my view it does reflect the general voice. But we shall see. 
::The real dispute , I think, is over the notability of fringe science and whether that can be considered science in any sense at all. This is a matter in which I think there is in fact no real consensus, but at best a temporary majority, and i expect this  question to continue to be the theme of AfDs. I don't think this guideline  lays it to rest '''[[User:DGG|DGG]]''' 23:36, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
::: This guideline cannot and should not judge whether something is &quot;real science&quot;.  In fact, all that a determination that something is &quot;not science&quot; can do here is to remove a topic from being judged by this criteria with no resolution on its notability or lack thereof.  IMO, we have a set of criteria here such that anything that is meant to be judged as part of science can be ruled on here, be it mainstream or fringe.  What I think that you will find is that the least palatable topics are those which also have had the least impact and are also therefore the least notable.  --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 01:53, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

== Some suggestions on organizing this project page ==

* The introduction is too long.  Limit it to &quot;what&quot; and &quot;why&quot;.  Get the commentary (i.e. &quot;impetus&quot;) and discussion of process into its own section.  Specifically address what makes ''science'' different from other areas covered by the general guidelines.
* Criteria should define at least these categories as guidance to editors:
** topics which on their face should be include (i.e. the notable)
** topics which are going to require some judgments to be made by editors if they are new articles or added to existing articles. (i.e. the maybe notable)
** topics which, at least according to the authors of the guideline, are ''improbably'' included. (i.e. nonnotable)
* The statement ''&quot;Decisions about including or excluding material must always reflect the opinions of outside authorities, not those of Wikipedia editors.&quot;'' is bizarre because the opinion of Wikipedia editors is what, by definition, compose the Wikipedia. ''&quot;Must always&quot;'' is a rather strange term to be found in a mere ''guideline'' at any rate. [[User:Patsw|patsw]] 13:22, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

:: If you wish to draft an alternate version, the feel free to do so ''elsewhere'' and present it to us as a possible replacement.  We are certainly amenable to productive changes.  However, IMO the current project page works and should be considered a functioning guideline. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:13, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
:I agree the ''reflect outside authorities'' wording is odd (although not any odder than &quot;notability is not subjective&quot; which expresses the [[WP:ATT|same sentiment]]). The rest doesn't strike me as an improvement. ~ [[User:Trialsanderrors|trialsanderrors]] 17:49, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

::One point that isn't being made (in the intro) and probably should be is the point that scientific theories cannot be properly presented without understanding their level of acceptance.  There's a big difference between a mainstream theory and a fringe theory, and even in an article about a fringe theory, it's important to describe it as one.  However, for some fringe theories, insufficient sources exist to back up the claim that they are fringe theories.  Thus we are left with only one real choice: disallow the article, as we cannot properly cover it while adhering to [[WP:ATT]] and [[WP:NPOV]].  This is different from, say, an article about a band, where it may be that no source reports on their popularity or number of fans accurately, but sources do report on other things: the information we can't cover can just be left out.  In articles on science, we really can't leave that out.  [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:41, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

:::The &quot;level of acceptance&quot; argument makes no sense to me. &quot;Theory&quot; in science has a very precise meaning which applies to models and descriptions which are as completely accepted as possible in an endeavor based primarily on the dubious activity of inductive reasoning. While there is a big difference between mainstream and fringe proposals, the proposals themselves are only considered &quot;theories&quot; when they pass the tests of the scientific method. What makes a proposal fringe is, ostensibly, its inability to pass these tests. This doesn't mean that scientists don't make mistakes in pejoratively labeling the fringe out of the mainstream, only to say that the level of acceptance is something of a binary operator: either it's in or it's out. When an idea does not generate enough interest in the scientific community to create commentary from members of the community, it must either be uncontroversial (as is the case with textbook knowledge) or it must be outside the scientific community. This is quite easy to verify. No amount of posturing and insisting on the part of a fringe idea's proponents that the idea is actually &quot;scientific&quot; is good enough when demarcating for our purposes. We might still have articles on the idea if there is &quot;extra-scientific&quot; interest in it, but we do not need to shy away from being honest about its &quot;extra-scientific&quot; nature. One of the problems that many pro-fringe editors have is that they believe that because [[negative proof|proving the negative]] is in principle a defiance of [[WP:ATT]] that reasonable editors can't make editorial judgments with regards to the status of a particular idea. This is simply not the case at all: we are editing an encyclopedia not compiling a list of sources. After all, that's why we have editors in the first place: we are charged with summarizing the available data in the most conformist way possible. When all the data is outside the scientific community and the idea purports to have scientific importance, it is perfectly fine to delineate the contradiction. However, this discussion is probably better suited for [[WP:FRINGE]]. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:09, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

*I think it is a little more complicated than that.
*It is not ''necessary'' to give an indication of the acceptance of a theory, in order to describe it.
*And I don't think the word &quot;theory&quot; has such a precise meaning as scientists would like. For example, Wikipedia calls the [[Big Bang]] a &quot;theory&quot;, whereas the Encyclopedia Britannic calls it a &quot;Model&quot;. And I am sure there are more sources supporting both.
*This is why the new [[WP:A]] is so important. I can attribute both the Big Bang Theory, and the Big Bang Model, but I can find no source which agues it must be one or the other.
*I can also find no attribution labelling many minority subjects as &quot;fringe&quot;, nor claiming a certain level of acceptance. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 17:47, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

== Making this an approved guideline ==

I notice that Kevin Murray has downgraded this guideline back to the &quot;proposed&quot; status.  I would revert that myself, except that I am not at all clear by what action/authority it became considered a functioning guideline.  Certainly the above poll has produced only five people who support this as a guideline.  Even without the two nay-sayers I fail to see how the five of us constitute a group that can speak for the Wikipedia community as a whole, or at least the science editors.

I for one do call for the issue of approving this as a functioning guideline be presented to the community as a whole.  [[Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)|the Village Pump policy forum]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Science|WikiProject Science]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Physics|WikiProject Physics]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Chemistry|WikiProject Chemistry]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Biology|WikiProject Biology]] are all places where this guideline can be advertised and input and approval sought.  I see little danger in this and much promise, but mostly I would like to be able to show Kevin a formal approval so that is downgrading of this guideline cannot occur again. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 02:17, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

::We don't do &quot;formal&quot; and &quot;official&quot; with respect to guidelines. What matters is if this is (1) a good idea and (2) used as such in practice.

Judged by this talk page and AFD, the answer to all three is 'yes', so this page is a de facto guideline and Kevin is the lone dissenter here. Of course, putting a notice on the village pump never hurts.

:::Kevin is not the only dissenter, I also am.  Let me enumerate some general criticisms, this time relating to the substance of the proposal.  1.  There is not a big need for this.  Most science articles up for deletion are up for other concerns than notability, primarily, concerns that the article is original research, POV, or inadequately sourced.  Although there are many debates on the test pages subpage, in very few was the critical issue the notability of the subject: [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Electric universe (concept)]], [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Socionomics]], and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Growing Earth Theory]] (and the old debates, not listed there, about [[Time Cube]]).  2.  The list of criteria, a core part of this proposal, were not used as the basis of successful arguments in any of the key examples I listed.  Rather, the test seems to be the general one of being covered in multiple independent sources, inside or outside of the scientific community.  Note that the criteria give an opportunity to supporters of OR articles (real OR, not neutral attempts at describing published research) to argue for inclusion inappropriately: see [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sorce theory]] as an example of this.  The criteria have changed since then, but the same kind of argument could be made today.  I wouldn't want to jeopardize any of those debates by having a guideline here with such minimal applicability.  3.  The list of criteria is instruction creep and isn't useful.  For articles that should be deleted, not meeting the criteria doesn't make a strong argument.  For articles that should be kept, they're okay, but arguments to delete things that meet these criteria are weak delete arguments in the first place, usually along the lines of &quot;this article is in bad shape&quot;, see [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ubiquitous computing]] for example.  The criteria seem aimed at solving a non-existant problem of the over-deletion of notable science topics.

*The fundamental flaw of [[WP:SCIENCE|Notability (science)]], is that it tries to determine only whether an article is '''scientifically''' notable. It does not consider whether an article may be notable in '''any''' other area.

*: This is a true red herring IMO.  A failure of scientific notability does not mean that an article may have notability in another manner and therefore be worthy of inclusion.  I did have wording here to that effect at one time, but it seems to have been lost.  I will see to restoring that, as I see this guideline as being usable only as a means of inclusion.  For the purposes of exclusion, the failure of a topic to merit inclusion under any guideline (including this one) is the relevant matter. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:27, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
*:  (Edit conflict) Agree with EMS; The page clearly embraces the idea that popular notability for science topics is appropriate.  Since popular notability definitely is acceptable (see the [[Time Cube]] precedent, for instance), any wording that implies otherwise should be examined.  But you aren't correctly representing the main thrust of the proposal.

::*I did not suggest that failing scientific notability means that an article MUST be notable elsewhere. I wrote that it MAY be notable elsewhere. Yet the current policy does not consider this.
::*Deleting articles based on scientific notability alone, is an incredible conceit, and should play no part of the proposed guidelines. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 17:35, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
:::*I'm not sure what your point is.  If an article is scientifically notable, fine, it's keepable.  If an article is not notable scientifically, but notable in some other way (for example, in popular culture), fine, it's keepable.  But if the article is not notable in any way at all, why should it be kept?

::::*A number of articles have already been deleted, based on whether they were scientifically notable only, or worse, ''mainstream'' scientifically notable.

:::::* So what?  I see this as something that can and should happen.  If no other grounds are being offerred to justify notability, then the article should go.  I would point out that the deleted items cited as being &quot;non-mainstream&quot; are also considered &quot;non-notable&quot;, while other items have been kept as being &quot;notable&quot; but &quot;fringe&quot;.  It seems to me that this shows that this is a reasonable and workable scheme. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 22:09, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

::::::*No other grounds for notability are offered because the articles are considered only as to whether they are scientifically notable.
::::::*For example, the article on [[Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Ralph_Juergens|Ralph Juergens was deleted]] (a) based on a Scientific notability &quot;test case&quot; (b) on the grounds that he was a &quot;non-notable non-mainstream scientist&quot;, which is accurate, but no cause for deletion by itself.
::::::*It is improper for &quot;Notability (science)&quot; to '''solely''' judge any article for deletion, as it makes no attempt to attract expert editors in other fields --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 23:12, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

:::::::* If you are saying that a deleted article had another non-scince reason for being notable, then please name it and indicate why that reason was not considered at the time.  Also do note that in such cases a request for reconsideration can be made to [[Wikipedia:Deletion review]].  However, this standard is for determining notability with respect to science, and I find it to be quite silly and disingenuous to accuse this guideline of not doing something that it is not meant to so (namely seeking non-science-related reasons for inclusion). --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 01:56, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

::::::::* Ian, I hear you.  However your objections are ''way'' off base here, because what you don't like is that a consensus of Wikipedia editors has disagreed with your stance on certain topics.  That doesn't really have any bearing on whether or not that consensus exists.  You talk like [[WP:SCIENCE]] got Ralph Juergens deleted: no.  A consensus of editors and a discussion got it deleted, and frankly, it wasn't even based on [[WP:SCIENCE]] at all, more like on [[WP:BIO]] or [[WP:PROF]].

:::::::::*No, I am criticizing the make-up of the consensus, which is predominantly science-oriented editors who decided that Ralph Juergens was not notable because he was not a mainstream scientists; That is what the summary says. The AfD was not targeted outside of Notability (Science).
:::::::::*The main reason given for deletion of &quot;Ralph Juergens&quot; was that he &quot;is only published by vanity presses&quot;; not only is this false, but it fails civility guidelines,[[WP:COI#Importance_of_civility]]. Nevertheless, this was picked up by several other editors as their reasons for supporting the AfD.
:::::::::*But this is not the place to discuss a single article, but I offer this as an example. 
:::::::::*I think it is wholly inappropriate for WP:SCI to advertise articles for deletion. WP:NOTABLE should advertise AfD, giving a editors a chance to refer to WP:SCI and OTHER notability guidelines. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 10:46, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

==One researcher POV fails NPOV==
*The third paragraph includes an incorrect statement:
:&quot;the point of view of one researcher or research term and, unless it generates a significant outside response by the scientific community or the population at large, fails NPOV&quot;
*This is a complete misunderstanding of [[WP:NPOV|NPOV]]. If we attribute a statement to a single researcher, and it conforms to [[WP:A]] and is not misrepresented, then it conforms to NPOV. The argument is whether a statement by a single researchers is ''notable'', which is completely different. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 19:26, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

::*If another attributable view is available, we describe it. If it isn't, we don't pretend there might be one. There is no double whammy.
::*Describing the POV of one person does not automatically fail NPOV, and any decent editor can describe any POV in way that fulfils NPOV.
::*Quashing a POV on the grounds that there MIGHT be a hypothetical counter-POV, fails NPOV, fails WP:A, and fails WP:V. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 00:08, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

:::::*The only requirement to provide a balanced view, is if one exists. If it doesn't, then to pretend that a view &quot;needs balancing&quot;, is presumably based on the view of an unattributable, anonymous, expert-less editor. This fails numerous Wikipedia policies.

:::::*Yet both POVs are EQUALLY valid, as long as they are not misrepresented, and can easily be described in a manner that conforms to NPOV. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 13:15, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

:::::::What you fail to realize is that there is an informal community discussion as well as a formal publication discussion. Those who are in a particular community are aware of the informal discussion and are able to tell when a topic is ignored/scoffed or when it is accepted. This cannot be reported at Wikipedia for verifiability reasons, but it still raises NPOV concerns when certain editors try to force obscure research into the forefront of an article. You are mistaking a standard of verifiability (which is the standard for how to write an article) with editorial judgement: they need not be one-in-the-same. In other words, one need not &quot;verify&quot; that there is NPOV issues because, as editors, our editorial opinions do not need to be (nor can they be) verified. The only thing that needs to be verifiable is the text of the article. We are allowed to have judgements that are external to this. As such, it is perfectly reasonable to say that there are NPOV problems with someone citing a single, isolated, though published research paper. In terms of your dark matter red herring, you have totally misconstrued the situation, and I'm fairly confident that nearly any third party not firmly ensconced in pathological skepticism toward mainstream astrophysics would find your evaluation predictably myopic. Clowe's triumphalist attitude is only justified from the standpoint of [[standing on the shoulders of giants]]. It's not like he was publishing his &quot;proof&quot; of dark matter in a vacuum -- it was a particular point that was addressed to a particular (MOND-type) objection. However, when your hypothetical John Doe bucks the established research by publishing proof against dark matter, he is publishing in a vacuum. Prof. John Doe's work is marginal and therefore marginalized by Wikipedia. Clowe's work is mainstream and therefore reported by Wikipedia. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:47, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
::::::::SA is quite right about verifiability vs. editorial judgement.  However, I have to say I worry when editorial judgement of this type comes into dispute.  Wikipedia needs sources for two reasons: one is to have attributions in the articles, but another reason is that it levels the playing field in editorial discussions.  Inherently, experts on Wikipedia are not set above ordinary editors, but they may be more familiar with the subject in question.  But experts have to prove themselves, just like anyone else.  Fundamentally, Wikipedia is a community of equal editors.  So, this is a good argument ''for'' [[WP:SCIENCE]]: in order to avoid having to rely on editorial judgement too heavily, we look for a higher standard of quality in sources for scientific topics, and where that doesn't exist, we should avoid covering the subject.

:::::::::*Let's not mix up NPOV and editorial judgment. As I said earlier, the statement in the introduction is incorrect concerning NPOV. I also said it may concern notability, so I'm not dismissing the point. But let's be accurate as editors.
:::::::::*The idea that a community has informal discussions which a particular editor may be aware, is worthless. It is not verifiable, nor attributable. 
:::::::::*I know THREE different communities, all of whom have informal discussions, and promise peer reviewed papers that I could mention too. Also worthless.
:::::::::*An encyclopedia does not run on material gleaned from Chinese whispers via anonymous, unaccountable editors.
:::::::::*I had previously brought this up at the Neutrality Project, see &quot;[[Wikipedia_talk:Neutrality_Project#NPOV_misunderstanding|NPOV misunderstanding]]&quot;. They agree. A singular POV can be described in an NPOV manner. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 16:01, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

NPOV is inherently based in editorial judgement. The only way that someone determines whether there is a problem with NPOV is by making an editorial judgement. That's why the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{POV}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag comes with the wording it does. Disputes arise between editors over NPOV: if there was a singular editor there would never be NPOV issues from the standpoint of writing an article. While I agree with Mangojuice that editors are judged external to their status as &quot;experts&quot; (see ongoing conflicts over [[WP:EXPERT]] for example), the community doesn't deny the existence of experts either. No one is saying that the encyclopedia should be &quot;run&quot; on expert judgement or the whispers of whatever anonymous and unaccountable ethnic group, but people are saying that editors may come to the table with these concerns. That's the essence of the NPOV guideline: all the points-of-view are placed on the table and the marginalization happens per the outside community and references to the outside world. No one is saying that a singular POV cannot be described, but people are saying that singular POVs present unique difficulties when writing an encyclopedia that is supposed to be NPOV. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 17:39, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

:*Indeed, all the POVs are placed on the table. And if there is just one POV (because there is one WP:V/WP:RS/WP:A), then we can still write that POV so that it conforms to NPOV, regardless of whether you or I or anyone else agrees with the POV, and regardless of whether it is mainstream of pseudoscience.
:*In which case, the statement in the third paragraph that I described above, is incorrect. A view from a single researcher may fail a criteria, but there is no reason for it to fail NPOV; and if it does, any decent editor can re-write it so that it conforms to NPOV. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 19:19, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
:::If there is only one notable POV, then sure, we write about it. In which case the statement in the third paragraph is correct. A view from a single research written about on Wikipedia does have editorial issues related to NPOV for the reasons delineated because the alternatives may exist but cannot be included without falling into original research. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 19:23, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
::::*The statement is incorrect because a single POV does not fail NPOV unless it is written badly, in which case any competent editor can correct it. Sure, the statement may be allowed because it is notable. But it won't fail because of NPOV.
::::*A single POV that has been published elsewhere does not not fail &quot;Original research&quot;, because [[WP:NOR]] &quot;refers to '''unpublished''' facts&quot;. (my emphasis) --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 19:51, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

You are missing the point. Perhaps I should post here the statement that you dispute:

:''Research published in a reputable publication passes these thresholds but reflects the point of view of one researcher or research term and, unless it generates a significant outside response by the scientific community or the population at large, focusing on such research in a Wikipedia article does not adequately conform to [[WP:NPOV|Wikipedia's policy on neutrality]], in particular the section on [[WP:NPOV#Undue weight|undue weight]].''

You'll note that the point being made is that simply quoting published work is not good enough. Why isn't it good enough? Because unless the work in question has generated discussion it has not been vetted outside of Wikipedia to make it possible to write an article on the subject that adheres to the spirit and letter of NPOV.
--[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 20:36, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
::The POV of a single researcher in a single first-rate peer-reviewed publication, has normally been assessed by 2 or usually 3 independent scientists with a tendency to be ciritical. The assumption made by colleagues it that such results are correct unless proven otherwise. Are we supposed to be more critical of physics that he physicists who review for PRL? Then, if discussed by independent sources, as most scientific papers are, it is considered worth citing and commenting one. Reputable journals expect items listed as references to be relevant to the new work also. I'm a librarian. i think many articles in most library journals are basically trivial if not junk altogether.. But they are considered valuable by my colleagues in general, and its their trms that matter. I will judge by reporting theirs',  not imposing my own.'''[[User:DGG|DGG]]''' 09:02, 9 April 2007 (UTC)

:The statement which I quoted above, is as follows:
::&quot;the point of view of one researcher or research term and, unless it generates a significant outside response by the scientific community or the population at large, fails NPOV&quot;
:A single POV may fail, or being accepted by some other criteria. But a single POV does not fail NPOV (unless an editor writes poorly). 
:*To suggest that a statement based on a single POV, changes it's NPOV standing, depending on some other ''potential'' discussion whose view is yet to be determined, is illogical. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 20:46, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

If your point is that someone can attribute a single point of view in a fashion that is NPOV, that is absolutely correct. However, not every attributable point can be written about in a neutral fashion. An example of a quote that may be non-neutral though properly attributed and sourced is given at [[WP:FRINGE#Sourcing and attribution]]. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 00:01, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

:*Since describing a single POV can be achieved in an NPOV fashion, then the description in the third paragraph is incorrect which says that a single POV without response fails NPOV.
:*Judging/assessing a single POV is another matter altogether. But just because there may be no attributable assessments, does not make the description of a single POV automatically fail NPOV. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 00:34, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

I do not agree with the demand that not only must something be said in a respected peer reviewed journal, but that we must wait for other independent researchers to chime in, in OTHER respected peer reviewed journals, and agree with the first researcher that the claim is valid. The first post would constitute a reliable source satisfying [[WP:ATT]] and would be usable in a Wikipedia article. Similarly a book from a respected publisher would constitute a reliable source, without waiting for some other authority to write another book that says &quot;I agree with the first book.&quot; The demand places the bar way too high. It may be years before someone completely independent of the first researcher publishes the demanded blessing of the first researcher's claim. [[User:Edison|Edison]] 20:20, 9 April 2007 (UTC)

==[[Schmidt Sting Pain Index]]==
Can some of you knowledgable and discerning scientist Wikipedians take a look at this please? This article has currently been getting some coverage in popular &quot;gee whiz funny link of the day... how goofy!&quot; type blogs ( I hate it when this happens and the article in question is dubious... I think it gives a bad impression of wikipedia), but it seems to be mainly based on the idea that this one insect scientist guy wrote some goofy comments for an insect sting pain index one day. Ok, I agree that insect scientists are allowed to have senses of humour (WITHIN LIMITS, for the sake of us all), but I am concerned that 1) this scale is not really widespread and may be just one scale promoted by one guy without much acceptance in the insect expert community. 2) the pdf article linked which this wikipedia entry seems to be based on does not seem to say that Schmidt actually wrote those goofy comments. Its a bit ambiguous, but its seems to say that &quot;the media&quot; (without specifying what media) came up with the goofy comments to append to Schmidt's original dry scale(I think this may be another case where people exaggerate or misinterpret what an article is saying). I dont have any access to science journal databases, and am certainly no science or insect expert. But these concerns and quick scans of google books and google scholar led me to bring this issue to wiser heads. Thanks very much  for checking this out.

The index also has been mentioned in popular science pubs; though it doesn't appear to be taken seriously by scientists.  A scientifically-based pain index would be interesting (though I decline any offers to participate in such research); both this and the related Starr index appear to be little more than the opinions of the bug guys in question.  The article certainly dances on the edge of notability.  --[[User:EngineerScotty|EngineerScotty]] 05:30, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

******Ok, once again, in case anyone can actually respond on my point: the list of criteria here seems to be a misguided attempt to define reasons for notability that no one brings up in debates.  If the issue was the over-''deletion'' of science articles, having these criteria would make sense.  But it seems to me that the main thrust of this proposal is in the opposite direction.  These are just fodder for disagreement (see [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sorce theory]] for instance) and distract from the main point about the POV and OR issues involved in using only sources from a single author.

********Good: a direct response.  Two brief points: (1) Arbcom never asked for criteria, but they did encourage developing a guideline, which is different.  (2) The EU deletion debate looks very different to me - there, the argument was done from first principles and it worked very nicely, and it skirted around the edge of these criteria (no one ever talked about whether the EU concept was &quot;textbook science&quot; or had institutional support)... and as for extended discussions with Iantresman... I don't think the criteria will make one bit of difference, and that's not a very good reason anyway.  Long-winded debate... I don't think we should seek to avoid it as a general principle, debate is a good thing.  Criteria would simplify the job but scientific topics aren't exactly overwhelming the AfD lists.

== General notability guideline template ==
Since the general notability guideline is central to most sub-pages, someone came up with the idea of creating a centralized template which will be consistent among the permutations from WP:N.  Please see whether we can make this work here.  The text is meant to be fairly generic, but it may make sense to add text following the template for fine tuning, or help us to make the template more applicable if it is not reflecting the consensus for notability.  I certainly didn't get everything that I wanted, but I'm very happy to see the compromises that make this a fairly representive of the attitude of the project.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 01:12, 7 April 2007 (UTC)

==Merging [[Wikipedia:Notability (numbers)]]==
What are the thoughts on merging [[Wikipedia:Notability (numbers)]] into this guideline proposal?  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 19:15, 25 April 2007 (UTC)

I've added a brief section which is the meat from the numbers guideline.  This seems appropriately and neatly combined here.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 16:29, 15 May 2007 (UTC)
*It's a bad idea, as explained on the talk page of WP:NUM.

== Scope creep ==

I may be beating a dead horse here, but all the references to NPOV, proponents and advocacy make it seem like this is about pseudoscience/fringe science, and the discussion above seems to confirm it. As it tries to apply to specialised but uncontroversial science, not much of it bears any resemblance to reality. --[[User:Abu-Fool Danyal ibn Amir al-Makhiri|Abu-Fool Danyal ibn Amir al-Makhiri]] 02:29, 6 June 2007 (UTC)

== Proposal concerns (LV) ==
Note that I came here from a couple of AfDs which were trying to present this as policy criteria for an article's deleltion.  As I read down the line, I encountered several problems with the proposed guideline.  I apologize if any and all of the below have been covered in the Talk Archives, which I am not going to read now.

Problems that I have at present with the proposal:

*Introduction:
:* &quot;A topic that is acceptable under this guideline is an appropriate part of Wikipedia.&quot;
::Pretty sweeping blanket statement, to me.  No other Notability criteria I'm aware of suggests that &quot;if it passes this, it's in.&quot;  Indeed, it seems to violate the principle of a Guideline to me, which always limits itself to allow potential exceptions.  Further, each section usually defines which criteria are primary and which are secondary.
*Notability of topics related to science:
:*&quot;Decisions about including or excluding material must always reflect the opinions of outside authorities, not those of Wikipedia editors.&quot;
::I know this has been mentioned above, but I want to echo this concern:  Decisions about including or excluding material must always reflect the consensus of the Wikipedia editors.  Anything else beyond that is helpful clarification, or it becomes fodder for people to [[WP:IAR]].
::I'd feel much more comfortable with something like, ''&quot;Deicions about including or excluding material on a scientific basis ought to be supported by the opinions and stated facts of outside authorities, as per [[WP:RS|Wikpedia:Reliable Sources]].&quot;''  Start throwing 'musts' around in anything but policy (perhaps only unbreakable/unmodifiable policy) and you'll get a lot of irate editors, scientific or not.
:*&quot;Although publication creates verifiability and reputable journals are reliable sources, publication by itself is not a sufficient (and sometimes not necessary) standard for encyclopedic notability. Unpublished research fails no original research and often lacks verifiability, so it is unacceptable by policy. Research published in a reputable publication passes these thresholds but reflects the point of view of one researcher or research term and, unless it generates a significant outside response by the scientific community or the population at large, focusing on such research in a Wikipedia article does not adequately conform to Wikipedia's policy on neutrality, in particular the section on undue weight. This guideline clarifies how the Wikipedia community has applied NPOV to articles on scientific topics. It does however not apply to the inclusion of scientific research as authorative sources within articles. The criterion for such sources is not that they are notable, but that they are reliable.&quot;
::Wha?  Could this be any more complex?  I actually had to diagram this paragraph out to understand it.  My hypothesis is most editors will not.  Can't you simply say it is normally necessary to follow the general notability guidelines with respect to neutral, multiple, independent, verifiabile, reliable sources?  And if you do that, what is the point of this whole section - I'm seriously not understanding how this adds anything to present guidelines.
* Criteria / General
:*&quot;1. Widely cited. Papers covering the topic have been widely1 commented on in academic writing within the topic's field.
::2. Outside notability. The topic is notable due to significant coverage in reliable sources outside of academic publications.&quot;  
::So we want articles only commented upon widely by multiple academic sources, which also are commented on outside academic sources?  Seems pretty wide, to me.
::Aside from that, I know I read somewhere that Wikipedia is not just a general encyclopedia, but can cover articles appropriate to special subject encyclopedias as well.  Thus 2. might well fail, as most specialist encyclopedias I am aware of have many articles which would only be known inside the discipline the encyclopedia represents.
:*&quot;Notable topics which are primarily non-scientific... [etc.]&quot;
::Boy, I'm going to love the AfDs which try to define whether a topic is &quot;science&quot; or not trying to use this.  Not to mention the arguments you'll get whether or not cosmology (for example) has a scientific basis or not.  Not to mention you're setting up a criteria which is so subjective it will rarely-if-ever be able to objectively define where this guideline would be relevant or not.
::Also, you will get editors asking whether the guideline itself applies or not - something I don't think I've ever seen with any of the other specialty N's about the guideline ''itself''.  I don't need to know if Burpa-Cola has been covered in the Cola News and CNN, or if Billy Bob Arthbutnott has both parlimentary opinions as well as the Sun documenting his career to know that Corp or People:Politicians applies.
*Scientific terms
:Again, how does this get beyond neologisms in a way that Avoid Neologisms doesn't, aside from adding the words &quot;scientific literature&quot;?
*Numbers and Sources
:*&quot;1. Have professional mathematicians published papers on this topic?
::2. Is the sequence listed in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences? (In the case of sequences of rational numbers, does the OEIS have the sequences of numerators and denominators of the relevant fractions?)
::3. Do MathWorld and PlanetMath have articles on this topic?&quot;
:::This may be taken from WProj numbers, I don't know.  But are you stipulating that 2 and 3 are reliable sources? (The Sources section has exactly this same problem.  You're controlling what is considered a Reliable Source without allowing the Wikipedia community at large to define that.  I have a problem with that - if I were arguing Notability(Religion), I would not want it to say that the Bible is an authorized source and any other 'holy' texts by default would have to prove themselves.)
*Sources
:*&quot;Scientific discovery is often disconnected from public discourse, so standard methods of sourcing and verifying are not always applicable. A scientific topic which yields low hit counts in the Google test...&quot;
::That's nice.  The Google test is widely regarded as discredited anyway.  Yes, I know it's still used, but it's questionability is known.
::Also, verifying and sourcing is verfying and sourcing.  I believe what's being aimed at here is scientific notability may have a smaller and different base (with different types of sourcing) for inclusion than other forms of notability.  So why not say that?  Except that above you're demanding 'popular' coverage as well as academic.
:*&quot;Web (and library) searches should therefore be evaluated based on the quality rather than the quantity of the finds.&quot;
::Thus, you allow extreme subjectivity creep, unless you are going to make further instruction creep in what constitutes scientific quality.  (My Jung is better than your Freud.  My Hawking beats your Einstein.  My t test is better than your bean counting.)  Common sense might be able to dictate that, but science is full of periods of flying in the face of qualitative common sense and succeeding - because it's right.
:*&quot;The following is a list of sources with qualifications of their usefulness.&quot;
::Again, you're preaching what is and isn't acceptable as a source, without allowing the community consensus to decide this over time. 
:*&quot;Google, Yahoo.... [etc]&quot; 
::Uh, again, how is this any different from Google test?

Finally, may I invite you to consider that most notability guidelines are much less complex and much more tolerant of letting individual cases be decided as individual cases?  And I hope that the question about &quot;Have we reached consensus?&quot; is asking if you as the editors have reached consensus about what you want to present to the community as a whole, as opposed to &quot;Are we ready to make this policy ourselves?&quot;

It may seem like I'm pissing all over your proposal.  I hope it doesn't, because I'd like to see a Notability(Science) guideline.  But I want it to be one that's usable and used - I wouldn't do either with this, and I'd argue as need be when someone tries to use this as a vote justification (which will happen, whether you want it to or not.)  Sorry for the length of the diatribe.

The rejected tag is appropriate and should stand until there is adequate discussion here to demonstrate active interest in the proposal.

It looks like a number of the contributors here are no longer active at WP: Lantreman ws banned, BDJ and Science Appologist have quit, Minder Binder, Abu-Fool Danyal ibn Amir al-Makhiri, and Laughing Vulcan have not contributed substantially since June and at all since mid-July.   &lt;s&gt;Trials and Errors and Radiant are advocating reinstating this as a proposal&lt;/s&gt;, but I don't think that there are enough editors who see this as a need.

* What I see now is something that is so watered down and nebulous that it cannot act as a genuine policy.  If people want to revive this effort, then we need to return to a version like [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Notability_%28science%29&amp;oldid=117329647 this one] and work from there.  IMO, what happenned to this effort is that a number of people whose pet articles were running afoul of this proposed policy chose to get involved with the blatant intent to sabotage it and remove its impact on their work, and unfortunately succeeded in doing so.&lt;br&gt;IMO, there is a genuine need for a policy like this to clarify what &quot;notability&quot; and &quot;verifiability&quot; mean in the context of a science article, and how [[WP:UNDUE]] should be applied.  It may be that this is an issue that is best handled by the admins with the advice and consent of the community so that we can avoid the pitfalls of the past. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:49, 20 August 2007 (UTC)
*I see, if not frequent, so at least [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere/Wikipedia:Notability_%28science%29&amp;limit=500&amp;from=0 recurrent use] of this guideline/proposed guideline/essay, very much in keeping with the rather low number of science-related AfD discussions. Absence of discussion on the talk page certainly doesn't establish rejection. I agree with EMS that the two-item version is watered down beyond recognition of the original version, and I don't see any consensus for it. ~ [[User:Trialsanderrors|trialsanderrors]] 16:07, 20 August 2007 (UTC)
:: Per [[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines]]: ''&quot;A rejected page is any proposal for which consensus support is not present, regardless of whether there is active discussion or not. Consensus need not be fully opposed; if consensus is neutral on the issue and unlikely to improve, the proposal is likewise rejected. It is considered bad form to hide this fact, e.g. by removing the tag. Making small changes will not change this fact, nor will repetitive arguments. Generally it is wiser to rewrite a rejected proposal from scratch and start in a different direction.&quot;'' --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 16:14, 20 August 2007 (UTC)

::: It seems to me that a lot of work has gone into turning this into something that everyone can reject.

== Reverted to earlier version ==

I have reverted the article to the form of lat March, with some twaking of the lead and the first section.  The revised first section now has a simple first paragraph that states the need to this policy as succinctly as I can.  The next two paragraphs have had their order exchanged so that the farily dry &quot;relevance&quot; paragraph comes last.  The previous last paragraph has been removed as an unreadable mess.  (I believe I drafted that paragraph originally, but it really never worked as intended, and only got worse over time.)

The {{tl|rejected}} tag has been kept as a matter of form, with the {{tl|proposed}} tag just commented out but still present.  I for one would be happy to see this version go back to &quot;proposed&quot; status, but I want to see if others are on-board for doing that.  Let's just say that after having taken a rest, I am ready and willing to work towards acceptance of a functional version of this as a policy or guideline if others are. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 18:24, 20 August 2007 (UTC)

:Personally, I don't see a lot of point reviving this.  The criteria have always been an attempt to change practice rather than an attempt to document practice, and to most people, the criteria and the proposal are one and the same.  The criteria really haven't caught on, and from my experience, people rely on other policies for scientific topics, like [[WP:OR]] and [[WP:V]], and where notability is needed, the general [[WP:N]] seems to be sufficient and its use is accepted.

:: Having looked more closely at the edit history, I find that your attempt to streamline this two two items has met fairly stiff resistance.  Then again, that is little wonder since your proposed consolidation ends up being little more than a restatement of pre-existing policy.  The goal of this proposal is to set up guidelines that go beyond the current policies and which are adapted to the issues which are unique to science.  Wikiepdia has very much outgrown [[WP:NOR|&quot;No original research&quot;]] and the requirement to use [[peer review]]ed [[scientific journal|journals]].  What do you do with a source that is &quot;peer reviewed&quot; but where the peers are fellow followers of a [[fringe science|fringe theory]]?  What do you do about the use of [[Nature (journal)|Nature magazine]], which is highly respected but does not use peer review to help select its articles?  What do you make of a theory published in a respected scientific journals but on which noone has cared to comment except the author?  What do you do with the [[cold fusion]] controversy created by Pons and Fleishman back in 1987 which obviously is notable within science but which was never respected by it?  There will not be many of these to contend with, but when they do appear this guideline will be invaluable.
:::::Please excuse my comment here, but the article content of Nature is peer reviewed. Like some other journals, it has on rare occasions published things based on consensus of the key editors, without formal peer review. The news content is not, of course, just editorially prepared -- by the most careful people around. It was they who caught the similarity of the stem cell photos after the peer reviewers missed it.

:: You like to cite [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sorce theory]] as a place where this guideline did not work.  For that I solidly disagree.  That article's creator had to play all kinds of games with these criteria to make a case for keeping the article.  In the end, his attempts to make the article look acceptable only helped to do it in.  In context this is a farly powerful tool.  In addition, it is not going to do in fringe science articles.  For example, I helped by have an aritcle on a book by [[Halton Arp]] kept because it was noted within the field of astronomy and also gained some measure of attention from the public at large.  That press coverage (both scientific and popular) could establish notability as described here was helpful in that discussion. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 01:03, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

:::You might note that my reduction to two criteria stood for over two months without comment.  You may also note that coverage by press and by scientific sources were the criteria I left in place, since those are the only part of the criteria that are useful.  What I object to are the other criteria, like &quot;textbook science&quot; or &quot;popular belief&quot; that are redundant and provide loopholes for argumentative POV pushers.  Can you hypothesize an example where a topic is &quot;textbook science&quot; or has a &quot;prominent advocate&quot; or has &quot;institutional support&quot; where the topic would be acceptable for Wikipedia ''without'' significant coverage in independent, reliable sources, academic or otherwise?

::::I am not sure whether I agree with you or not. I certainly think that there are science articles that are best referenced by standard textbooks, particularly for articles that are at the level of high school or early university science. For example, we probably do not want to source a peer reviewed journal on [[density]] and we do not. Are textbooks reliable sources? If so we do not need to mention &quot;textbook science&quot;, but if they are not, we probable do. --[[User:Bduke|Bduke]] 03:09, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

::::::: As for the other criteria: you agree on 3 and 4.  6 is totally pointless, because none of the criteria would expire once met.  7 obviously must require sourcing to back it up or it's totally vacuous and anyone could claim it about anything.  And anything discussed in a legitimate textbook is already covered in a reliable source, and I highly doubt that we'd ever find a case where one textbook mentions a topic but absolutely no other sources do.  Yeah, I agree, if we pare it any further, the ''criteria'' say nothing more than [[WP:N]] does.. so maybe we should lose the criteria altogether, or just spend more time explaining the issues that arise in assessing the quality of sources, especially academic ones.

(unindent) I think that you have just made an excellent suggestions in calling for an explanation of how to assess the reliability and relevance of sources.  Given some of the issues I have had recently with the anti-relativists over at [[talk:Herbert Dingle]], this makes a lot of sense.  (In those discussions, at least one person would take anything that he could find from a &quot;peer reviewed journal&quot; as evidence of a conflict over relativity and the [[twin paradox]].  Said contributions come from almost unknown overseas journals and in another case a blatantly anti-relativity publisher.)  I would still keep the remaining criteria as a way of saying that those things are the primary hallmarks of scientific notability, while noting that other options for notability are not prohibited. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:20, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

:I believe that's better, but I still think we should remove the criteria.  The problem is, people always seem to conflate a notability guideline and its criteria, while all other text is ignored.  By not having criteria, we would force people to read the discussion about the reliability of scientific sources.  (Actually, come to think about it, &quot;Notability (science)&quot; may not be the best name.  What about &quot;Reliable sources (scientific)&quot;?)

:: The criteria don't exist for the benefit of those that would abuse them but instead for the benefit of those that are looking for good guidance on what is acceptable.  The creator of an article will invariably try to defend it against an AfD.  IMO, if the article's creator can make a case that their article is acceptable under this criteria and everyone agrees, then these criteria have done a service in helping people to make that decision.  Similarly, if people listen to the creator's case and conclude that it does not hold water, then the criteria will also have helped by focussing the debate on the relevant issues and helping to bring about the deletion.  So as I see it these criteria overall are helpful.  Besides, it really is in the absense of clear guidelines that you get the nastiest debates. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 19:01, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

(a) Notability, (b) reliability of a source, and (b) reliable of the facts in that source, are all quite different, and tell us how to describe information, not whether to include it. If Arp publishes some information in an obscure overseas publications, and Stephen Hawkins in in Nature, Arp's supporters will find his article more notable, and no less reliable. And if Hawkins is described in a textbook, then it tells us that his ideas have a wider readership, and neither are as popular as today's astrology column.  &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment was added by [[Special:Contributions/{{{IP|{{{User|84.244.165.174}}}}}}|{{{IP|{{{User|84.244.165.174}}}}}}]] ([[User talk:{{{IP|{{{User|84.244.165.174}}}}}}|talk]]) {{{Time|17:34, August 21, 2007 (UTC)}}}&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Abandon this as an unnecessary complication==

Whether a peer review journal, a textbook, a popular book, a university hosted website or a notable persons personal site  is sufficiently reliable, reputable, or secondary is probably best treated on a case by case basis, and in any case this is not a problem specific to science.

Are there any controversial articles that are better treated by Notability (science) than by WP:NOR, WPV, and WP:N?  I think not.  I think there are too many guidelines, especially where they overlap.  True science should only need to satisfy WP:NOR and WP:V.  Where the subject is not true science, or is borderline, a further test should be simply whether others have written about it.  WP:N provides this test.  A lot of work has been invested in this project page, but that is not sufficient reason to adopt it.  It is rule creep, and it does damage by obfuscating more important policies and guidelines.

There seems to be tendency here for some to want a guideline to provide a science-quality test.  This is not an encyclopaedia’s role.  The ascribing of “Finge science”, “pseudo science” or “lunacy” to any theory is a job for third party sources, not for wikipedia rules.  

EMS suggests that some nasty debates exist because of the weakness of this guideline.  Some elaboration would be nice.  Discussion above suggests to me that the relativity article needs work, not that wikipedia needs more rules.

This project page should be abandoned.  Science is well covered by WP:OR and WP:V, and where notability is needed, the general WP:N seems to be sufficient and its use is accepted. --[[User:SmokeyJoe|SmokeyJoe]] 02:08, 22 August 2007 (UTC)

It’s always about sourcing, specifically whether the sources are sufficiently independent, sufficiently secondary, sufficiently reputable (not a blog or similar), or covers the subject in sufficient depth.  These are all straight WP:N issues, deriving directly from a combination of WP:NOR and WP:V.  There is plenty of evidence of spirited debate in places about the science of the content involved, and this sometimes is uncivil, but such spirited debate seems to me to be irrelevant to the debates, and always a symptom of editors who are too far into OR editing and are not looking at the subject objectively.  This is why Notability (science) may do more harm than good.  It suggests that there is something special about science.  The criteria for inclusion in wikipedia do not depend upon the science.

==physics? i think not==
do not confuse the observer effect with the uncertainty principle. the uncertainty principle has nothing to do with &quot;observing&quot;, it has to do with measuring. the observer effect is a supposed effect of observing an event and the influence of your presence on the event. no one would ever have to actually observe a particle's position to obfuscate its momentum, the mere act of using the photons to measure its position, even if nobody ever observed it, would suffice.

-------------
don't you have to observe in order to measure?
-------------

Indeed.  But what does measuring have to do with Quantum Mechanics exactly?  

To measure is to observe the results of a measurement process [that ascertains the subject measurement].  Humans observe with their senses — the senses that humans have.  Other conscious beings, perhaps including computers, may have other senses with which they can implement tools for making measurements.  At the end of the day, measuring ''ALWAYS'' involves observing.  

Tools used by beings to make measurements are limited (in their accuracy) by various factors including the limitations of ones senses.  The often-mentioned example of bouncing a photon off of an atom to measure its position illustrates the problem with knowing the position ''AND'' momentum of ''THAT'' atom at the ''SAME MOMENT'' in time.  The concept usually centers on the fact that the position measurement photon will change the momentum of the subject atom.  But aren't there other aspects of this problem?  

In the limit (considering the non-zero mass of the atom and the non-zero energy of the photon), can one ever know perfectly even the position alone?  Perhaps so, since the mechanical inertance of the atom precludes its reaction at ''THAT'' infinitesimal instant in time.  

Why is not ''THIS'' example an instance of &quot;observer effect&quot; rather than the uncertainty principle, per se?  If one seeks only to measure the position alone, then maybe it is neither.  Then again, is it not &quot;Observer Effect&quot; even if the momentum is changed by measuring only the position?  One would think so.  

Well, what if we start with measuring the momentum &quot;first&quot;?  How does one measure momentum, anyway?  Again, we observers devise a measurement process that allows our senses to detect the &quot;answer.&quot;  Momentum is mass times velocity.  If we know the mass, we might then seek to measure the velocity.  Human observers tend to ascertain velocity by measuring position at two points in time.  For non-zero velocities, this means two different points in space, of course.  Yet, [instantaneous] velocity is ''DEFINED'' at only one point in space and time.  Thus, one cannot measure velocity (or momentum) in this manner: one must ''WAIT'' to ''SEE'' how fast it is moving, and this yields only an average (not instantaneous) value.  

Before continuing on to propose measuring momentum, per se, by some other means (say, smashing the atom into an obstacle at a known position), we should note that the Uncertainty Principle pertains only to Quantum Mechanics.  In ''THAT'' world, particles are not particles; rather, they are probability density functions.  The interpretation of this ''MODEL'' of a particle says the position and momentum of the subject particle are INHERENTLY uncertain by virtue of the mathematical model itself.  To precisely derive the position, one must manipulate the model in a manner that causes the momentum &quot;to drop out of the formula,&quot; and vice versa.  

The relationship between position and momentum described by Quantum Mechanics is somewhat like the relationship between the time domain and the frequency domain described by the Fourier Transform.  One can say that there is some similarity as well between position and velocity in Classical Mechanics.  In fact, the description above with knowing the velocity versus position of the atom is exactly that: Classical Mechanics. 

Following this line of thinking, one (''such as this user who is not fluent in the intricate semantics of Quantum Theory'') might be likely to reach these conclusions: 
 

'''1. Using &quot;particulate&quot; atoms and photons to describe the Uncertainty Principle of Quantum Mechanics is ''flat wrong''.''' 

'''2. One does not observe Quantum Mechanics.  Rather, one uses that theory to make calculations to explain the observations of certain experiments.'''

'''3. Measurements ''ALWAYS'' involve observations and therefore also ''ALWAYS'' involve the Observer Effect.  Perhaps this ''IS'' the “Theory of the Observer Effect.”'''

'''4. The Uncertainty Principle of Quantum Mechanics and the Observer Effect are ''fundamentally'' unrelated.'''  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:JimRodgers|JimRodgers]] ([[User talk:JimRodgers|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/JimRodgers|contribs]]) 12:54, 31 July 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

For some reason this article is more focused on what the observer effect is not. --[[User:Nathanael Bar-Aur L.|Nathanael Bar-Aur L.]] 20:09, 10 April 2007 (UTC)

From what I understood from other sources, the observer effect is basically the collapsing of a quantum system's wavefunction that happens the moment a measurement in made upon it (by an &quot;observer&quot;), therefore cancelling any superposition that may have existed beforehand, and giving specific definition to the renderings. Is this correct? --[[User:Nathanael Bar-Aur L.|Nathanael Bar-Aur L.]] 20:21, 10 April 2007 (UTC)

==Suggestions==
Current article states &quot;not that of the driveshaft, along the axis of the car&quot;.
Add a paragraph that illustrates this with the driveshaft of the front-engine, rear-wheel-drive Porsche 928.
Also industrial examples and diagrams from mechanical engineering and classical mechanics.
e.g. a torque tube to allign parts of a hinge operated by two hydraulic cylinders.&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/206.188.57.60|206.188.57.60]] ([[User talk:206.188.57.60|talk]]) 14:42, 30 October 2006 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;

== Diagrams ==
Can anyone find a picture of this? I'm having a very hard time picturing what this would look like...[[User:70.157.134.125|70.157.134.125]] 01:01, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

==Accuracy==
This page is not really accurate. Cars like the STS, Corvette, etc. have independent rear suspensions, and the torque tube is not used to transmit acceleration forces in these vehicles. Rather, it is because they have trans-axles in the rear of the car and it connects the trans-axle with the engine in the front. However, I am not enough of an expert on the subject to write a clear and well-written clarification so I have just added some templates to the top of the page. --[[User:Ozziegt|Ozziegt]] ([[User talk:Ozziegt|talk]]) 21:33, 1 July 2009 (UTC)

:Corvette since at least 1988 doesn't have a torque tube (unless they put one in later), and apart from the Miata I'm hard pushed to think of an IRS that uses one. I agree, this article is pretty horrid, it needs a rewrite rather than refs. [[User:Greglocock|Greglocock]] ([[User talk:Greglocock|talk]]) 11:13, 2 July 2009 (UTC)

:Corvettes since the late 90's do indeed have torque tubes, of the same type that the Porsche 924/944/928 etc use.  All the mentioned Porsches are IRS and use a torque tube.  Part of the probem with this article is that it lumps very diverse systems together;  the early Ford systems are completely different from the Corvette/Porsche systems.  Both are classified as torque tubes, but the article does not focus on the essence of a TT, which is the use of a smaller torque-transmitting element inside a carrier. The carrier may or may not be static and may or may not be carrying driveline forces (like the Fords). [[User:52FordF-1|52FordF-1]] ([[User talk:52FordF-1|talk]]) 15:44, 18 July 2009 (UTC)

::Yup my bad, 2005 Corvette (as a random example) uses a transaxle and a torque tube. Note that the Corvette system is different to the Peugoet one, as the latter includes an articulating joint at the front whereas the Corvette system does not. This is a big deal, to a driveline engineer at least.[[User:Greglocock|Greglocock]] ([[User talk:Greglocock|talk]]) 23:25, 18 July 2009 (UTC)

:Agreed. The article as written is essentially BS. A torque tube fundamentally counteracts the torque of the driveshaft; the alternative is that the torque is counteracted by the torsional rigidity of the frame (the net torque must, obviously, be zero otherwise the rear of the car would rotate). The torque tube often does transfer forward wheel force to the front of the car, but this is not inherent in the mere fact of having a torque tube: there must still be a mechanism locating the wheels longitudinally relative to the diff/transaxle. This is analogous to the usual need to locate the wheels relative to the frame (most simply, with leaf springs) in order to move the car forward.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/110.175.57.184|110.175.57.184]] ([[User talk:110.175.57.184|talk]]) 05:05, 18 March 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== simple definition? ==

It has been my understanding from looking through service manuals and talking to mechanics that the corvette style torque tubes are just an enclosed driveshaft that connects a front mounted engine to the rear mounted transmission (with fully independent rear suspension)

I guess it's not simply called a 'driveshaft' in a classical sense since it doesn't connect a front mounted transmission to the rear differential  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/184.57.87.173|184.57.87.173]] ([[User talk:184.57.87.173|talk]]) 20:38, 15 August 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</text>

'''''Hello!'''''

Thanks for uploading some pictures to Wikipedia.  I wanted to make sure you were aware of some of the requirements and good practices for uploaded images.

*'''Pick an image name.'''
:When [[Special:Upload|uploading]] an image, pick a file name that is descriptive, and unique.  Remember that many images may be uploaded about the same topic, and remember that names are case sensitive.

*'''Source the image.'''
:On the [[Help:Image page|image description page]], explain where the image came from.  If you created the image yourself, then say so.  If it's from the web, give a URL.  If it's a screenshot of a movie or game, or a scan from a book, give the title.

*'''Provide copyright and license information.'''
:This part is a little bit trickier, but it's very important.  The copyright of the image generally belongs to whomever created it.
::''If it's a photograph you took, or an image you created'' (modifying an image that already exists doesn't count) in software like [[Photoshop]] or [[GIMP]], then you own the copyright.  To upload it to Wikipedia, you must agree to license it under the [[GFDL]] (which allows anyone to use it, but requires that they give credit to the original author and requires that any further edit to the image be licensed under the GFDL as well) or release it into the [[public domain]] (which allows anyone to use it for any purpose without restriction.)  Do this by placing an appropriate [[WP:ICT|tag]] on the [[Wikipedia:image description page|image description page]], like &amp;#123;{[[Template:GFDL|GFDL]]}} or &amp;#123;{[[Template:PD|PD]]}}.  Be sure to mention that you created the image.  If you're using &amp;#123;{[[Template:PD|PD]]}}, you may also want to use &amp;#123;{[[Template:NoRightsReserved|NoRightsReserved]]}}, since there is some dispute as to whether one may grant items into the public domain.
::''If you didn't create the image,'' or the copyright somehow belongs to another party (like a screenshot, which you might &quot;create&quot;, but the copyright belongs to the author of the movie or video game), then you need to find another [[WP:ICT|tag]] that describes the copyright status of the image.  Images used on Wikipedia need to be free for our use and the use of [[WP:FORKS|sites]] which reproduce our content.  This means that images cannot have a restriction such as &quot;only for use by Wikipedia&quot;, or &quot;for non-commercial use only&quot;, or &quot;for educational use&quot;.  Images without a free license may be usable in certain articles under [[WP:FU|fair use]], but such a use should be justified on the image description page.

*'''Describe the image.'''
:To another reader, the image may not be immediately understood.  A caption in an article doesn't explain the image to a visitor who sees it on its image page.  Put a brief explanation of what is in the image on the image description page, similar to what you might include in a caption on an article.  

Some links to Wikipedia pages on this subject: 

'''[[Wikipedia:Copyrights#Image guidelines|Copyrights]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags|Copyright tags]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Fair use|Fair use]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Image description page|Image description page]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Granting work into the public domain|Public domain]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion|Images for deletion]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Possibly unfree images|Possibly unfree images]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Copyright problems|Copyright problems]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Uploading images|Uploading images]]'''

Thanks again for your contributions.  If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me at my talk page. [[User:Feydey|feydey]] 19:42, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

An '''anti-submarine missile'''  is a [[standoff missile|standoff]] [[anti-submarine weapon]]. Often a variant of [[anti-ship missile]] designs an anti-submarine systems typically use a [[jet engine|jet]] or [[rocket engine|rocket]] engine, to deliver: an [[explosive material|explosive]] [[warhead]] aimed directly at a [[submarine]]; a [[depth charge]], or;  a homing [[torpedo]] that is carried from a launch ship, or other  platform, to the vicinity of a target.
[[File:Ikara missile.JPG|thumb|right|&lt;small&gt;[[Ikara (missile)|Ikara]], an [[Australia]]n-designed missile used by several navies between the 1960s and 1990s; a [[rocket engine|rocket]]-parachute delivery system carried an [[acoustic torpedo]] up to 10 nautical miles (19 km) after launch. A variant re-designed in the UK and used by the Royal Navy could deliver a [[Nuclear depth bomb|nuclear depth charge]].&lt;/small&gt;]]
[[File:Maille-Braize-14.jpg|thumb|&lt;small&gt;The [[Malafon]], used by the French Navy between 1966 and 1997, used a rocket-assisted glider to carry a torpedo up to 8 nautical miles (13 km) after launch&lt;/small&gt;. ]]

==History==
[[Depth charge]]s were the earliest weapons designed for use by ships against submerged [[submarine]]s. These explosives were initially dropped as the ship moved over the presumed location of a submarine. Before World War II, shipboard [[sonar]] was unable to maintain contact with a submarine at close range. 

Various [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]]-type projectors, including [[hedgehog (weapon)|hedgehog]] and [[squid (weapon)|squid]], were devised during [[World War II]] to allow a ship to maintain sonar contact while lobbing explosive charges toward the submarine.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Terry, and Costello, John ''The Battle of the Atlantic'' (1977) Dial Press {{Listed Invalid ISBN|0-8037-6454-2}} pp.307-308&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the [[Cold War]], [[missile]]s were developed to provide greater range with reduced [[recoil]]. Some missiles and rockets carry [[homing torpedo]]es to provide terminal guidance for the warhead.&lt;ref&gt;Albrecht, Gerhard ''Weyer's Warships of the World'' (1969) United States Naval Institute p.385&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''northern river shark''' or '''New Guinea river shark''' (''Glyphis garricki'') is a [[species]] of [[requiem shark]], in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Requiem shark|Carcharhinidae]] found in scattered [[tidal river]]s and associated coastal waters in northern [[Australia]] and in [[Papua New Guinea]]. This species inhabits areas with poor visibility, soft bottoms, and large [[tide]]s, with immature sharks ranging into [[freshwater|fresh]] and [[brackish water]]. It is similar to other river sharks in having a stocky grey body with a high back, tiny eyes, and broad fins. It measures up to {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} long.

Northern river sharks are likely [[piscivorous]]. This species is [[viviparous]], with females bearing litters of 9 young possibly every other year before the [[wet season]]. Very rare and facing threats from [[commercial fishing|commercial]] and [[recreational fishing]], and perhaps also [[habitat degradation]], this species has been assessed as [[Critically Endangered]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]].

==Taxonomy==
The first known specimens of the northern river shark, two newborn males from Papua New Guinea, were discovered by [[New Zealand]] [[ichthyologist]] [[Jack Garrick]], after whom the species was eventually  named. This shark was referred to as &quot;''Glyphis'' sp. C&quot; until 2008, when it was formally described by [[Leonard Compagno]], William White, and [[Peter R. Last]] in a [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] paper. The [[type specimen]] is a female {{convert|67|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, collected from the [[East Alligator River]], [[Kakadu National Park]], [[Northern Territory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Compagno, L.J.V. |author2=W.T.

==Distribution and habitat==
The northern river shark has been reported from [[King Sound]], the [[Ord River]], and Doctors Creek near [[Derby, Western Australia]], the [[Adelaide River|Adelaide]] and [[Alligator Rivers]] in Australia's [[Northern Territory]], and the [[Daru]] region and possibly the [[Fly River]] in Papua New Guinea. It inhabits large [[river]]s, [[estuaries]], and coastal [[bay]]s, all of which are characterized by high [[turbidity]], silty or muddy bottoms, and large tides. Young and juvenile sharks are found in fresh, brackish, and salt water ([[salinity]] ranging from 2 to 36 ppt), whereas adults have only been found in marine environments.&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pillans et al&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pillans, R.D. |author2=J.D.

==Description==
Like other members of its genus, the northern river shark has a stocky body with a high back. The head is wide and flattened, with a broadly rounded snout and minute eyes equipped with [[nictitating membrane]]s. Each [[nostril]] is divided into a very large incurrent opening and a small excurrent opening by a triangular skin flap. The sizable mouth is broadly arched, with short furrows at the corners. Thirty-one to 34 tooth rows are in the upper jaw and 30&amp;ndash;35 tooth rows are in the lower jaw; the upper teeth are upright and triangular with serrated edges, while the lower teeth are narrower and straight to slightly curved. In the largest individuals, the first few lower teeth from the jaw median are spear-shaped with serrations near the tip.&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;/&gt;

The [[pectoral fin]]s are large and broad, with gently backward-curving margins and pointed tips. The [[pelvic fin]]s are triangular with nearly straight trailing margins. The first [[dorsal fin]] is long-based and triangular, with the apex almost forming a right angle; the second dorsal fin is some two-thirds as high as the first. The origin of the first dorsal fin lies over the pectoral fin insertions, while that of second dorsal fin lies over the pelvic fin rear tips. No ridge exists between the dorsal fins. The [[anal fin]] is smaller than the second dorsal fin and has a strong notch in the rear margin. The [[caudal fin]] has a strong lower lobe and a long, narrow upper lobe with a ventral notch near the tip. The [[dermal denticle]]s are small, oval, and overlapping, bearing three horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth. This shark is steel-gray above and white below; the color transition is sharp, located well below the eye, and becomes jagged on the sides of the trunk. The anal and caudal fins become dusky or black towards the trailing margins and tips. The maximum known length is {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}}. This species differs from the [[speartooth shark]] (''G. glyphis'') in several [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] and [[meristic]] characters, including having fewer [[vertebra]]e (137&amp;ndash;151 versus 213&amp;ndash;222) and a lower, jagged gray-white color boundary.&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;/&gt;

==Biology and ecology==
With its slender teeth, small eyes, and high density of [[ampullae of Lorenzini]], the northern river shark seems to be [[adaptation|adapted]] for hunting [[fish]] in conditions of poor visibility. In Doctors Creek, sharks may move to and from favored feeding areas with the tide.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thorburn, D.C., D.L. Morgan, A.J. Rowland and H.S. Gill. (February 2004). [http://www.environment.gov.au/coasts/publications/pubs/glyphis-wa.pdf The northern river shark (''Glyphis'' sp. C) in Western Australia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108234623/http://environment.gov.au/coasts/publications/pubs/glyphis-wa.pdf |date=8 November 2011 }}. Report to the National Heritage Trust, Murdoch University. Retrieved on 10 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Like other requiem sharks, this species is [[viviparous]], with the developing [[embryo]]s forming a [[placenta]]l connection to their mother after exhausting their supply of [[yolk]]. Females give birth around October, before the start of the [[wet season]], on possibly a biennial cycle. One female examined contained nine [[fetus]]es.&lt;ref name=&quot;pillans et al&quot;/&gt; The young are born at under {{convert|67|cm|in|abbr=on}} long; males [[sexual maturity|mature]] between lengths of {{convert|1.2|and|1.4|m|ft|abbr=on}}, while females mature between lengths of {{convert|1.4|and|1.7|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;/&gt;

==Human interactions==
The northern river shark appears to be extremely rare, though more subpopulations may remain to be discovered in Australia and Papua New Guinea. Based on present information, no more than 250 mature individuals are estimated to exist in the wild, with no more than 50 in any particular subpopulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt; This species is caught legally and illegally by [[commercial fisheries]] using [[longline fishing|longlines]] and [[gillnet]]s, as well as by [[recreational fishing|recreational fishers]]; [[habitat degradation]] may pose a further threat to its survival. Because of its low natural abundance, limited distribution, stringent habitat requirements, and susceptibility to various human-caused threats, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] has assessed the northern river shark as [[critically endangered]]. It has also been listed as endangered on the 1999 Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, and on the 2000 Territory Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act. Kakadu National Park may be an important protected area for this species.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt; No regulations restrict the capture of this species in Papua New Guinea.&lt;ref name=&quot;white et al&quot;/&gt;

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Zoidberg. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Zoidberg~enwiki that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]]. If you think you might own all of the accounts with this name and this message is in error, please visit [[Special:MergeAccount]] to check and attach all of your accounts to prevent them from being renamed.

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== Hare Krishna picture ==

There is a picture of a Hare Krishna procession in the [[Religion_in_Mexico#Buddhism|Buddhism]] section, even with a caption about them being buddhists. Hare Krishnas are not buddhists, they are hindus. The article is semi-protected so I can not correct that myself. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Wenzelkarbovski|Wenzelkarbovski]] ([[User talk:Wenzelkarbovski|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Wenzelkarbovski|contribs]]) 17:39, 22 April 2015 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Self-ascription fallacy ==

''The last census reported, by self-ascription, that over 95% of the population is Christian.''

The so-called self-ascription of the census is nothing but a silly way of measuring data. Obviously they count children as Christians just because their parents say so. This people should either be clear about this or not count children at all. By the way, since a couple of years ago the Catholic Church has started to indoctrinate [[Huichol]] kids. Shame on us, Mexicans. Shame on us... The Huichols were one of the very few indigenous people whose religious tradition haven't been polluted by Catholicism but now the church has started taking advantage of the poverty of this people and the new constitutional reforms to infiltrate to their villages and improvise &quot;schools&quot;. Of course they know that adults wouldn't let themselves be indoctrinated so they choose to attack young minds. Catholicism and ignorance have been the ingredients of our condition as a Third World country.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Scandza|Scandza]] ([[User talk:Scandza|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Scandza|contribs]]) 13:27, 30 May 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;


Can anyone explain why the Evangelical Free Church of America does so many, many missionary trips to Mexico, when it's a predominantly catholic country? I mean, there are definite ideological differences involved, but I wasn't aware the two churches actively tried to convert each other's members.


==First phrase==

Any interest in removing &quot;Unlike some other Latin American countries&quot; from the first sentence of the article? It does not seem to serve any objective purpose and seems slightly antagonistic.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Namenderkrieg|Namenderkrieg]] ([[User talk:Namenderkrieg|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Namenderkrieg|contribs]]) 15:34, 24 March 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Easter==

I'm removing this:

&quot;Some of them however, do not celebrate Easter because they think that the Easter Bunny is the devil. Instead of celebrating Easter, they like to eat Mexican Pizzas.&quot;

because it's obviously untrue and just stupid. I think the article should be rewritten though, by someone more experienced than I am.--[[User:PARCGOP|PARCGOP]] 14:09, 7 April 2007 (UTC)

==Contradiction?==
This article says that 95% of people in Mexico are Roman Catholic.  The Mexico article states that 95% of people are Christian, and only 89% are Roman Catholic.  Which is correct, or am I just confused?
[[User:Yumecosmos|Yumecosmos]] ([[User talk:Yumecosmos|talk]]) 02:20, 9 January 2008 (UTC)

== Rewriting ==

I have imported the Religion section from the article on [[Mexico]] and integrated the information that was only on this article. I also moved around paragraphs and added a subtitle to make reading easier. Finally I removed the stub templates and replaced it with the expand one. --[[User:Marianika|Marianika]] ([[User talk:Marianika|talk]]) 16:32, 19 May 2008 (UTC)

== What about non-believers? ==

What about atheists, agnostics, deists in Mexico? How many Mexicans actually believe in God? Is there any data about that?  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/213.196.243.113|213.196.243.113]] ([[User talk:213.196.243.113|talk]]) 22:41, 27 May 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Mexican Ethnic Religion (Mexicayotl) ==

This article lacks a part about the growing movement of Mexicayotl, or Ethnic Mexican Culture or Religion, which is the revival of &quot;Aztec&quot; religion. --[[Special:Contributions/79.45.49.143|79.45.49.143]] ([[User talk:79.45.49.143|talk]]) 12:47, 16 August 2010 (UTC)

== Typo in Nonreligious section ==

'''John Ralph Ragazzini''' (January 3, 1912&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pnxBAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=John+Ralph+Ragazzini+1912&amp;dq=John+Ralph+Ragazzini+1912&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjC4sew9dPVAhXMHJoKHeWmAFsQ6AEIKzAB Profile of John Ralph Ragazzini]&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; November 22, 1988) was an [[United States|American]] [[electrical engineer]] and a professor of [[Electrical Engineering]]. 

==Biography==
Ragazzini was born in [[Manhattan, New York City]] and received the degrees of B.S. and E.E. at the [[City College of New York]] in 1932 and 1933 and earned the degrees of A.M. and Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at [[Columbia University]] in 1939 and 1941.

Ragazzini was dean of the School of Engineering and Science at [[New York University]] and during [[World War II]] he was chairman of the Department of Electrical Engineering at Columbia University, where he was involved in the [[Manhattan Project]].

Ragazzini's notable students are [[Rudolf E. Kálmán]] (see [[Kalman filter]]s), [[Eliahu Ibraham Jury]] (see [[Z-transform]]), [[Gene F. Franklin]] (see [[digital control]]), and [[Lotfi Asker Zadeh]] (see [[Fuzzy sets]] and [[Fuzzy logic]]).

Ragazzini is also credited, along with Lotfi Zadeh, in 1952, to have pioneered the development of the [[z-transform]] method in [[discrete-time]] [[signal processing]] and analysis.

In 1970 he received the [[Rufus Oldenburger Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asme.org/about-asme/honors-awards/achievement-awards/rufus-oldenburger-medal |title=Rufus Oldenburger Medal |publisher=[[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] |accessdate={{Format date|2013|2|14}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, [[American Automatic Control Council]] named [[John R. Ragazzini Award]] after Ragazzini and he was the first recipient of the award. Ragazzini died on 22 November 1988, aged 76.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/24/obituaries/john-ragazzini-76-educator-and-engineer.html&lt;/ref&gt;

I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under [[Wikipedia:Fair use|fair use]] but there is no [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline|explanation or rationale]] as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags/Fair use|boilerplate fair use template]], you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with [[WP:FU|fair use]].

Please go to [[:Image:Brokeninpieces.jpg|the image description page]] and edit it to include a [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline |fair use rationale]]. Using one of the templates at [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline]] is an easy way to insure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template. Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.

If there is other other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on the other images used on this page.

The '''United Church, Chapel on the Hill''' in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]] was the city's main church during [[World War II]]. Dedicated on September 30, 1943 and completed late in October 1943, it was originally a multi-denominational [[chapel]] shared by [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and [[Judaism|Jewish]] congregations.&lt;ref name=NationalRegister/&gt;&lt;ref name=churchhistory&gt;[http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=category&amp;sectionid=4&amp;id=39&amp;Itemid=55 Church History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728092956/http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=category&amp;sectionid=4&amp;id=39&amp;Itemid=55 |date=July 28, 2011 }}, United Church, Chapel on the Hill website, accessed March 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architectural design ==
The building design is a [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] 700-series [[U.S. Army]] chapel.&lt;ref name=Townsite&gt;[http://oakridgevisitor.com/history/pdf/OriginalTownSites.pdf Chapel on the Hill] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517124718/http://oakridgevisitor.com/history/pdf/OriginalTownSites.pdf |date=May 17, 2008 }} in ''Jackson Square – the original Townsite'', Oak Ridge Convention and Visitors' Bureau&lt;/ref&gt; It is a frame building built on a three-bay rectangular plan with a [[Steeple (architecture)|steeple]]d [[bell tower]] and a [[gable]] entry [[porch]]. It was one of three Army chapels built using the same design in Oak Ridge during World War II. One of the other two chapels, the West Chapel in the city's West Village area, was later torn down, but the East Chapel in the East Village is still in use.&lt;ref name=NationalRegister&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfo.doe.gov/me70/history/NPSweb/Oak_Ridge_Historic_District_(Preferred).pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form for Oak Ridge Historic District |date=July 18, 1991 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829041710/http://www.cfo.doe.gov/me70/history/NPSweb/Oak_Ridge_Historic_District_%28Preferred%29.pdf |archivedate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The U.S. Army built the chapel to house religious activities, as one of numerous community facilities in the &quot;townsite&quot; area of Oak Ridge. The building was dedicated on September 30, 1943, in a ceremony that included [[prayer]]s and talks by a Jewish [[rabbi]], a [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|Catholic priest]], an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] priest, a [[Baptist]] minister, and the [[minister (Christianity)|minister]] who was serving the United Church congregation that eventually came to own the chapel.&lt;ref&gt;Charles W. Johnson and Charles O. Jackson (1981), ''City Behind a Fence: Oak Ridge, Tennessee, 1942-1946''. The University of Tennessee Press. Pages 127-129.&lt;/ref&gt; Its name, &quot;The Chapel on the Hill,&quot; comes from a reference in a prayer by the Knoxville Baptist minister who participated in the dedication.&lt;ref name=Townsite/&gt;

The United Church congregation that is housed in the Chapel on the Hill traces its history to July 18, 1943, when some 25 to 30 Christians of diverse denominational backgrounds gathered for Sunday worship in Oak Ridge's main [[cafeteria]]. Subsequently, several members of the group made plans to establish an interdenominational Protestant church, led by [[laity|layperson]]s, to include all denominations. A [[Presbyterian]] minister working in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] was engaged to conduct weekly services, and about 150 people representing 13 Protestant denominations became charter members of &quot;the United Church&quot;. Governing boards of laypersons elected to lead the new congregation took up their duties on October 24, 1943.&lt;ref name=pre1980&gt;[http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=51&amp;Itemid=55 Pre-1980 Historical Compilation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728093006/http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=51&amp;Itemid=55 |date=July 28, 2011 }}, United Church, Chapel on the Hill website, accessed March 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Chapel-on-the-Hill was completed that same month, the United Church and the local Roman Catholic Church were given control of the building, as the only two churches then officially operating in the [[Manhattan Project]] community. During the war, when Oak Ridge's Manhattan Project facilities were operating around the clock, the chapel building was also in use nearly 24 hours a day as a venue for worship services, [[wedding]]s, and other occasions for local workers of various Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish religious backgrounds.&lt;ref name=pre1980/&gt;

At the peak of wartime activity in Oak Ridge, when the population exceeded 70,000, the United Church employed four ministers and conducted worship services in the Chapel on the Hill, East Village Chapel, and the Jefferson Theater, as well as [[Sunday school]] classes in several local schools and a [[mobile home|trailer]] camp. By 1951, the United Church Chapel-on-the-Hill consolidated as a single [[interdenominational]] congregation, making its home in the Chapel on the Hill building.&lt;ref name=pre1980/&gt;

The United Church congregation purchased the chapel and {{convert|3.72|acre|ha}} of land from the [[U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]] on May 11, 1955 for a price of $17,116.&lt;ref name=pre1980/&gt; An adjoining educational building was added in 1956-1957.

It is felt that the article you created at [[Ethan cavett]] is not suitable for a Wikipedia article, which must have a [[Wikipedia:Notability|notable]] subject and be [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verifiable]]. I have moved it to [[User:{{PAGENAME}}]], which is where users are free to write about themselves. You are at liberty to move it back into the (Main) namespace but bear in mind that if you do so, it is likely to be nominated for deletion. 

Note, however, that the purpose of a user page is to enable active editors of Wikipedia to introduce themselves to other editors. [[WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_a_blog.2C_webspace_provider.2C_or_social_networking_site|Wikipedia is not a general hosting service]], so your user page is not a personal homepage. Content unrelated to Wikipedia or its editing is likely to be removed.

Please see [[WP:User_page|the user page guidelines]], especially [[WP:User_page#What_can_I_not_have_on_my_user_page.3F|this section]] for more information. -- [[User:Omicronpersei8|Omicronpersei8]] ([[User talk:Omicronpersei8|talk]]) 19:36, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

'''Archer''' is a [[slab serif]] typeface designed in 2001 by [[Tobias Frere-Jones]] and [[Jonathan Hoefler]] for use in ''[[Martha Stewart Living]]'' magazine. It was later released by [[Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones]] for commercial licensing.

==Structure==

The typeface is a [[Slab_serif#Geometric_model|geometric]] slab serif, one with a geometric design similar to sans-serif fonts. It takes inspiration from mid-twentieth century designs such as [[Rockwell (typeface)|Rockwell]].

The face is unique for combining the geometric structure of twentieth-century European slab-serifs but imbuing the face with a domestic, less strident tone of voice. [[Ball terminal|Balls]] were added to the upper terminals on letters such as ''C'' and ''G'' to increase its charm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Devroye|first1=Luc|title=Jonathan Hoefler|url=http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-27370.html|publisher=McGill University|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Italic type|Italics]] are true italic designs, with flourishes influenced by calligraphy, an unusual feature for geometric slab serif designs. As with many [[Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones]] designs, it was released in a wide range of weights from hairline to bold, reflecting its design goal as a typeface for complex magazines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Typographica review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Earls|first1=David John|title=Archer|url=http://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/archer/|website=Typographica|accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
The typeface has been used for, among other things, branding for [[Wells Fargo]] and is a main font for the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' and [[Wes Anderson]]'s film ''[[The Grand Budapest Hotel]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=Lauren|title=Is Archer's Use on Target?|url=http://www.aiga.org/is-archers-use-on-target/|publisher=AIGI}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the current font used for titles and body text by the [[Design Observer]] website.

===[[Katisha]]===
Contains no information not in [[The Mikado]] article, the point of the spin-off unclear, as the character only appears in one opera, and it's unclear how this could expand further. In normal circumstances I'd say merge or make it a redirect, but, as I said, everything IS covered in [[The Mikado]], and I can't imagine someone searching for &quot;Katisha&quot;.

*'''Delete''' article per nomination.  Anything notable about this character should appear in the plot summary of ''[[The Mikado]]''.  There is no reason to have a separate article for this character.  -- [[User:Ssilvers|Ssilvers]] 19:59, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Redirect''' it to [[The Mikado]] -- merge isn't needed since the info's there, but the redirect could be useful -- somebody could search for it. -- [[User:ArglebargleIV|ArglebargleIV]] 22:15, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

A tag has been placed on [[:Nonamaker]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article seems to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable [[Wikipedia:Notability|(see the guidelines for notability here)]]. If you can indicate why the subject of this article is notable, you may contest the tagging. To do this, please affix the template &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; to the page and leave a note on [[Talk:Nonamaker|the article's talk page]] explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself.

Please read the [[WP:CSD|criteria for speedy deletion]] (specifically, article #7) and [[Wikipedia:Notability (people)|our general biography criteria]].

== Waterboarding ==

Could you post a link where somebody calls [[surfing]] [[waterboarding]]?  I can't seem to find any. [[User:Jehochman|Jehochman]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Jehochman|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:46, 26 April 2009 (UTC)

Yes, Waterboarding is a very common term in Hawaii, the Western US, Australia and even some former Soviet countries. Here's a link to an article where the author references this http://mydailyclarity.com/2009/03/surfing-for-peace-in-the-gaza/. Also, I found a site that references waterboarding here http://www.hawaiiansouthshore.com/shop/product.php?productid=17375. It get's confusing; I was looking for 'surfing' but we call it Waterboarding so I got to the wrong page ;-)

: Fair enough.  That source uses &quot;water boarding&quot; with a space.  I've made a change to your edit to reflect the space. [[User:Jehochman|Jehochman]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Jehochman|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:23, 26 April 2009 (UTC)</text>

I removed &quot;2006 is only his second full season as a team-manager. It took other team managers, such as [[Frank Williams]] many years to win a grand prix as manager.&quot;

This suggests Fry is responsible for a dramatic turnaround in the team's performance - their 2005 and 2006 performances have been widely acknowledged to have been poor to middling. the circumstances of the Hungarian GP were also exceptional. [[User:Mark83|Mark83]] 19:37, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

::It has been reported in the Telegraph (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/motorsport/formulaone/5369856/Monaco-Grand-Prix-Jenson-Buttons-playboy-days-behind-him.html) that Nick Fry owns a proportion of the team, and in an earlier article, that he owns the majority stake. Shouldn't this be added?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/92.239.225.23|92.239.225.23]] ([[User talk:92.239.225.23|talk]]) 23:17, 28 May 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Klein-Glienicke Schweizerhaus 1.jpg|thumb|320px|''Schweizerhaus'' in [[Klein Glienicke]] near [[Berlin]], designed by [[Ferdinand von Arnim]], 1867]]
'''Swiss chalet style''' ({{lang-de|Schweizerstil}}, {{lang-no|Sveitserstil}}) is an [[architectural style]] of [[Historicism (art)|Late Historicism]], originally inspired by rural [[chalet]]s in [[Switzerland]] and the [[Alps|Alpine]] (mountainous) regions of [[Central Europe]]. The style refers to traditional building designs characterised by widely projecting roofs and facades richly decorated with wooden balconies and carved ornaments. It spread over [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Austria-Hungary]] and [[Scandinavia]] during the ''[[Belle Époque]]'' era.

==History==
[[File:Villa Fridheim, Krøderen, 2.jpg|thumb|Villa Fridheim in [[Krødsherad]], Norway]]
Swiss chalet style originated in the [[German Romanticism|Romantic]] era of the late-18th/early-19th century, when the ideas of the [[English landscape garden]] inspired parks and residences in Germany, such as the [[Dessau-Wörlitz Garden Realm]]. It became highly appreciated on the continent by noble landowners who were impressed by the &quot;simple life&quot; of people living in the mountains. 

The chalet style soon spread over the German ''[[Mittelgebirge]]'' landscapes such as the [[Harz]] mountains or the [[Dresden]] area and the adjacent [[North Bohemia]]n region. As a &quot;modern&quot; building style, it also influenced the [[resort architecture]] along the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] seaside, like in [[Binz]] or [[Heringsdorf, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|Heringsdorf]]. Around 1900, design elements were used in the construction of numerous bourgeois family homes as well as by notable architects like [[Heinrich von Ferstel]] to build larger mansions and hotels. 

The style was further popularized by the first waves of tourism of rich people from the North and West of Europe and became popular in other parts of Europe and North America, notably in the [[architecture of Norway]], [[architecture of Iceland|Iceland]] and [[Architecture of the Netherlands|the Netherlands]] and in the [[country house]] architecture of [[architecture of Sweden|Sweden]] and [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati (Ohio, USA)]], in the late 19th and early 20th century. English examples of the chalet style include the [[Boathouse at Belton House]], [[Lincolnshire]], by [[Anthony Salvin]] and the Swiss Cottage at [[Osbourne House]], on the [[Isle of Wight]], constructed for [[Queen Victoria]]'s children.

==Characteristics==
The style is characterized by:
*[[Gabled roof|Gabled roofs]] with wide [[eaves]]
*Exposed construction beams, including large [[Bracket (architecture)|brackets]]
*Decorative carving and mouldings
*[[Balconies]]
*Large windows
*[[Weatherboarding]], usually painted, often in bright colors

The result was '''delete'''. -- [[User:Jitse Niesen|Jitse Niesen]] ([[User talk:Jitse Niesen|talk]]) 12:28, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

:In case anybody requires an explanation how I arrived at this decision, as it is a bit borderline: There seems to be only one reliable source, an article repeated in USA Today and other media. What tipped the balance is firstly the weak reasons in some of the &quot;keep&quot; comments (specifically, those of necronudist, Portillo, and I don't understand Minfo); and secondly, I think we should be extremely cautious in having articles about living children. -- [[User:Jitse Niesen|Jitse Niesen]] ([[User talk:Jitse Niesen|talk]]) 12:45, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

* '''Delete''' - he's ten years old, for crying out loud. If he makes it as a pro then add him in but not until then. [[User:Qwghlm|Qwghlm]] 20:09, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
**'''Comment''' You can't delete or not delete an article purely based on age. --[[User:Pinkkeith|Pinkkeith]] 20:11, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
***'''Comment''' - the point is that he doesn't meet [[WP:BIO]]. There are thousands of kids with potential; they get articles here when that potential is realised by playing for the first team of a significant club. WP is not a crystal ball. [[User:BlueValour|BlueValour]] 20:53, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
****'''Comment''' Well, that wasn't the point that you made, but it does pass [[WP:BIO]] based on [[WP:GOOGLE]]. There is no crystal ball to this article at all, it is all based on present information and known fact. --[[User:Pinkkeith|Pinkkeith]] 21:00, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
*****'''Comment''' What &quot;known fact?&quot;  There is not a single source cited in the entire article.  I am particularly leery of this becoming another AFD where the article is kept because of references cited in the AFD discussion that never make it into the article thus defeating the entire purpose of this discussion and [[WP:V]].  --[[User:ElKevbo|ElKevbo]] 14:26, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
*We can, however, '''delete''' an article if no reliable sources are provided when challenged under [[WP:V|verifiability policy]].  Pinkkeith, can you point us to featured coverage in mainstream media?  Some of those are needed to let us keep the article.  Being signed to a youth team isn't notable enough to get thousands of other kids their own WP articles.  [[User:Barno|Barno]] 20:39, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
** Here is a [http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/technology/maney/2005-02-01-maney_x.htm USA Today article] on him. In there the writer mentions that he was covered in numerous other newspapers. --[[User:Pinkkeith|Pinkkeith]] 20:43, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
*** - fine but he has achieved nothing in the adult world - the press references are the result of a splendid publicity campaign for his video but that doesn't confer notability. [[User:BlueValour|BlueValour]] 20:57, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
**** That's blatent [[ephebiphobia]]. Reread the article, the entire article is talking about the video and how it made him notable. --[[User:Pinkkeith|Pinkkeith]] 21:01, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

[http://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=%22Jean+Carlos+Chera%22&amp;btnG=Search+Archives&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8 Google News Archive] search yields 74 unique hits- more than enough to qualify as &quot;the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person.&quot; How old the subject is and the method in which he was made notable isn't relevant; the subject meets [[WP:BIO]]. --[[User talk:Rory096|Rory096]] 21:14, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
:*'''Comment''' - most of the content, apart from his birthdate, fails [[WP:V]]. The Ghits mean we can keep the article not that we must. They are all the result of a single video being published on the internet and they have all picked up the same story.

[[User:BlueValour|BlueValour]] 16:58, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''-So he's a child prodigy, that doesn't make him notable.  Some of my friends are amazing at basketball, but they don't have any articles.  As above, if he makes it to the pros (or college, if Brazil has a college league, I dunno), then we can always repost.

*'''Delete'''  When he has played for Manchester United, Arsenal, Porto, Eindhoven or Real Madrid he will have earned his article.  Until then it is worth remembering that, at least in the UK, it would be highly improper for professional clubs to express an interest in a 10 year old, let alone to 'openly court' them.

*'''Delete''' I've reviewed some of these news articles. I can read only the English ones, which are basically the same novelty one-shot story, repeated, or something like the USA today story, which is more about how everyone is famous on the Internet than a biographical source for an article.

Many of the users are very bias against the idea of a 7yr old having its own article or the fact that his only a child prodigy, but indeed we have a child prodigy article. Im definately getting a sense of outright bias and a feeling that many of the voters here are americans. [[portillo]]

*'''Comment''' - I think most of the delete (and some of the keep) votes are completely missing the point. Of course this kid isn't a notable footballer. He is however notable as an internet/media phenomenon. Wikipedia has plenty of articles for such people, as an example go look at [[Mahir Çağrı]]. Then at the bottom of his page have a look at the categories he's placed in. When someone comes to Wikipedia and searches for &quot;that kid i saw clips of on TV&quot; or &quot;that kid my mate sent me videos of&quot; and who's name give 35,000 google hits... He should be here! [[User:Alii h|aLii]] 15:20, 6 November 2006 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' per norm. [[User:Minfo|м info]] 23:03, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - I wonder if there is a misunderstanding here? If you are a child prodigy as a piano player you can play the piano. If you are a child prodigy as a mathematician you can do complicated sums in your head. Here, the kid undoubtedly has unusual ball skills but that doesn't make him a footballer. I also don't see him as a 'internet/media phenomenon' with any longevity - with YouTube such phenonima come and go like snow in the sun. [[User:TerriersFan|TerriersFan]] 00:01, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
:He was born as a YouTube phenomen but now he's known by all of the users above, has google entries and BBC articles. Guys, you wanna delete him, let's do it. Simply there are people who search for him and people who know him, there are many articles on paper magazines about him, but if you are too zealous to keep a 9-years-old top-youngster 'cause &quot;well, dear Watson, it fails WP:BIO =_= ahem&quot; let's do it. Do it and stop arguing bullshits. --[[User:Necronudist|necronudist]] 09:24, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

The '''European Federation of [[Financial Analyst]]s Societies''' ('''EFFAS''')[http://www.effas.com] is the federation of [[financial analyst|analysts]] associations in Europe. EFFAS comprises 27 member societies representing more than 14,000 investment professionals. EFFAS was founded in 1962 and the headquarters is located in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]].

Besides its European training programme CEFA (Certified European Financial Analyst) EFFAS also grants the Certified International Investment Analysts (CIIA) designation, ensuring professional qualification by offering global as well as local market knowledge within its examination structure. As a global designation the exams can be taken in different languages. Through the national member societies EFFAS provides a full range of services for capital market experts.

==CIIA Certification==
EFFAS participates in further developing the [[Certified International Investment Analyst]] (CIIA) examinations, a financial analyst designation recognised globally. Analysts who belong to European analyst associations that are members of EFFAS, are eligible to participate in the final CIIA examination, if they pass the foundation and the national exams, or if they hold the Certified European Financial Analyst diploma (CEFA).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Big Andy, (Andrew Walsh) was born in Louisville, Ky., on Feb. 12, 1978.  His father, Frank Walsh and mother, Marsha Sils were overly delighted to have him, since their first son, Patrick, was a dud.  Big Andy was known through his childhood as being pretty funny.  His brother, not so much.  His parents divorced in 1981, after his father recuperated from emergency brain surgery, after falling through the roof at his work and landing head first on the concrete below.  He continued to work there until he passed away after a 3 year battle with melanoma, in 2006, a week before his 54th birthday.  His mom remarried and had another child, a daughter named Brittani (Gamble).</text>

{{Wikipedia subcat guideline|notability criteria|{{PAGENAME}}|[[WP:NMS]]&lt;br&gt;[[WP:SCIENCE]]}}
--&gt;
{{rejected}}

Ideas related to science are an important part of any comprehensive [[WP:ENC|encyclopedia]].  This guideline and its criteria are intended for use in determining whether a topic is notable due to being a part of or related to science.  The tests in this guideline are intended to be fairly rigirous so that a topic that is acceptable under this guideline can be considered an appropriate part of Wikipedia.  However, the failure of a topic to meet this guideline's criteria does not automatically exclude it, as it may attain notability through [[WP:N]] itself or another of its subsidiary guidelines.

==Notability of topics related to science==

The need for this guideline comes from there being a set of topics which do not fail the test of the [[Wikipedia:No original research|No original research]] policy or the [[Wikipedia:Attribution]] policy but which none the less are not appropriate to Wikipedia because they do have sufficient notability.  Such topics mostly represent new findings and theories, as well as past findings and theories that have failed to gain significant attention in either scientific circles or the public at large (or so far failed to gain said attention).

A key element to understanding this guideline is that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a research publication, and as such Wikipedia does not usurp the usual validation processes of scientific institutions such as [[peer review]], [[scientific consensus]], and academic recognition. Decisions about including or excluding material must always reflect the opinions of outside authorities, not those of Wikipedia editors. Inclusion or exclusion is therefore not a judgement on the validity, importance or accuracy of a scientific contribution, but simply a reflection of the quality and quantity of responses it received inside and outside the [[scientific community]].

This [[WP:N|notability guideline]] derives its relevance from the policies [[WP:NOT|What Wikipedia is not]] (in particular [[WP:NOT#IINFO|Not an indiscriminate collection of information]] and [[WP:NOT#CRYSTALBALL|Not a crystal ball]]), [[WP:NOR|No original research]] and [[WP:NPOV|Neutral point of view]] (in particular [[WP:NPOV#Undue weight|Undue weight]] and [[Wikipedia:Neutral point  of view/FAQ#Pseudoscience|Pseudoscience]]), as well as the guidelines [[Wikipedia:Conflict of interest|Conflict of interest]] and [[WP:AUTO|Autobiography]]. Also of importance are [[WP:V|verifiability]] and [[WP:RS|reliability]] policies.

==Criteria==
=== General ===
In general, a contribution in the field of science is notable enough to merit inclusion in Wikipedia if it meets at least one of the following criteria:

#'''Textbook science.''' There is regular non-incidental mention of the contribution in general or specialized textbooks published by reputable presses.{{ref|1|1}}
#'''Widely cited.''' Papers covering the contribution have been widely cited{{ref|2|2}} in its research field{{ref|3|3}} relative to other papers in the same area. Self-citations, and citations in journals which are not respected within the relevant research field should be excluded.
#'''Press and fiction.''' It is or was well known due to extensive press coverage, or due to being a recurrent theme in notable works of [[fiction]]. In this case the article should make note of this status. A single article on the theory, even if from a major media source such as ''[[New Scientist]]'' or ''[[Scientific American]]'', is not a sufficient criterion.
#'''Historical interest.''' It has historically met any of the above criteria within the scientific community or the culture at large but has since either been [[superseded scientific theory|superseded]], disregarded, or dismissed by the scientific community or the culture at large. The article should make note of the subject's status in this regard.
#'''Popular belief.''' It is or was believed to be true by a significant part of the general population, even if rejected by scientific authorities.

Notable topics which are primarily non-scientific in nature but which contain claims concerning scientific phenomena, should not be handled as scientific.  For example, the ''[[Book of Genesis]]'' itself is primarily covered as a religious scripture rather than as a cosmology. On the other hand, subjects such as [[creationism]] or [[creation science]], which involve a direct conflict between scientific and religious doctrine, are properly evaluated both on a scientific and theological basis. Similarly, subjects purporting to have a scientific basis may be noteworthy primarily on cultural or sociological bases, such as UFOs, which can usefully be discussed from several different perspectives.

:{{Seealso|Wikipedia:Notability (science)/Irrelevant arguments}}

===Scientific terms===
:''See also [[Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms]]
A scientific term is considered notable and worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia if the following can be established:
# A commonly agreed-upon formal or informal definition
# A trajectory of use for the term in the scientific literature from [[WP:RS|reliable]] and [[WP:V|verifiable]] sources
To determine notability it is important to keep in mind that different fields sometimes use the same term to describe different concepts. On the other hand, especially in the early stages of a field, terminology is often not standardized and different terms are used for the same concept. The policy on [[WP:NAME|naming conventions]] gives more information on the choice of the proper term when more than one term is used in the scientific literature.

== Assessing the reliability and relevance of sources ==

Journals from which citations and evidence of notability are obtained are expected to be well known and respected within the relevant research field.  The previous requirement of citation from a peer-reviewed source is not alone sufficient by this requirement.  (Peer review is done just as easily by a fringe science journal as by a leading journal, while [[Nature (journal)|Nature magazine]], one of the most respected [[scientific journals]] in existence, uses editorial as well as  peer review for submissions.)

Textbooks should either be well-known and respected or produced by a reputable scientific publisher (which is most likely the same publisher as one or more respected journals).

Journals from scientific societies of developing countries are occasionally not reliable.  If a finding in such a journal should prove to be of great scientific interest, that finding is often reprinted and/or reported in reliable scientific sources.  In such a case, the original journal article can be cited as a primary source, but its relevance should be backed up by secondary citations in known reliable sources.

For biographical articles and articles on fringe science, there is some loosening of these requirements.  Works by the topic of a biographical article are relevant to the article whether their writing was published in a reliable journal/publisher or not.  Also, the contents of a journal devoted to a fringe science can provide evidence as to the past or current thinking within that fringe field.  However, the fringe science journals cannot provide evidence for the outright notability of the topic.

==Notes==
{{note|1|Note 1}}:  The scientific contribution must have a major entry in the work. A passing mention of the concept is not sufficient. 

{{note|2|Note 2}}:  Citation counts and peer review mechanisms differ vastly between sciences, fields, and subfields, and editors are urged to inform the relevant [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Council/Directory/Science|WikiProject]] about ongoing debates to get expert input. It should also be noted that ''quantity'' of citations is often only a poor approximation of ''quality''.

{{note|3|Note 3}}:  A &quot;research field&quot; indicates an established area of study for which the topic in question is only a part.  A topic cannot be its own research field, nor can it gain notability from being part of a field which is non-notable.

__NOTOC__
===Overview===
After much deliberation of the [[Wikipedia:Danny's contest/Contest entries|contest entries]] the judges have arrived at a decision.

The entries could be broken down into three broad groups... entries that didn't seem to have much, if any, improvement, entries that were a &quot;good try&quot; and a handful of entries that really took the contest to heart and added a lot of interesting and germane references.

===Criteria===
The judges graded on 4 major criteria:
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!Criterion
!Description
!Weight
|-
|'''Number of citations'''
|Just a  raw count of how many were added. This was a good filter to see if the article could make the finalists... only 2 or 3 refs suggested that maybe not so much had been done.  
|(20%)
|-
|'''Complexity of citations'''
|A gauge of the difficulty level of adding them. Were they notes? web cites? book cites? did they use ISBN tagging? were there multiple places that got the same note? Notes ON notes? 
|(30%)
|-
|'''Appropriateness of cites'''
|Were they actually GOOD cites that moved the article forward?
|(20%)  
|-
|'''Overall article improvement'''

|'''[[Battle of Ceresole]]'''
|An important battle in medieval history, part of the [[Italian Wars]] series. Characterised by contemporaries as &quot;marvellously confused&quot; this battle is attractively illustrated with lots of maps and diagrams. One would expect Kyrill as coordinator of [[WP:MILHIST]] to do a good job of improving an article, and Kyrill does not disappoint. A very powerful article about an interesting battle.

|'''[[Theramenes]]'''
|An important general and historical figure of ancient Greece, including participating in an Athenian coup, multiple battles, and a rebellion. He even had notoriety after death. The article is challenging due to a paucity of sources, but Robth found 80+ cites. There also is an innovative organisation of sources into modern and ancient. A very good article based on some painstaking research.

|'''[[Crawford expedition]]'''
|A very understudied but important battle in the [[American Revolution]]. The winning side often tends to ignore battles they lost, and this article was not much more than a single paragraph stub when Kevin went to town on it. It is now profusely illustrated with maps, paintings, tables and diagrams and has grown to 43 Kb. In addition to 88 high quality footnotes, it also has a comprehensive &quot;references&quot; and &quot;for further reading&quot; section, properly separated out. All books have good ISBN links. This article is a real tour de force and shows the power of our encyclopedia well.

That all of these articles were somehow military related was surely coincidence! :)

'''Joe Eubanks''' (born 1975) is an [[United States|American]] [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] best known by the [[ring name]] '''Lobo'''. He wrestled primarily in [[Combat Zone Wrestling]] (CZW), where he won every major championship and was the first inductee into the [[CZW Hall of Fame]] in 2004. He was formerly the CZW Commissioner/Talent Coordinator.&lt;ref name=&quot;Online World of Wrestling&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/040207.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling 5th Anniversary Show February 7, 2004 - Philadelphia, Pennsylvania - ECW Arena|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===1999-2002===
Along with [[Nick Gage]], [[Justice Pain]], and [[Ric Blade]], Lobo was trained by [[John Zandig]] at the CZW Wrestling School and graduated first in the class.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freewebs.com/andy_czw1/history.html CZWHookup : The history of CZW] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210134119/http://www.freewebs.com/andy_czw1/history.html |date=2008-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He became one of the main wrestlers in CZW along with other graduates from the school. In February 1999, Lobo became the second [[CZW Iron Man Championship|Iron Man Champion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Online World of Wrestling&quot;/&gt; He held the title until June when he lost it to Justice Pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/990619.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling - CZW Down in Flames June 19, 1999 - Mantua, NJ |accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two continued wrestling each other and competed in the first ever Cage of Death match at the first ''Cage of Death'' show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/991016.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling - CZW Cage of Death October 16, 1999 - Mantua, NJ|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lobo won the match and regained the title. He would lose this title to [[Matt Prince|Wifebeater]], but regain it one more time the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/000311.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling - CZW March Violence March 11, 2000 - Sewell, NJ|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lobo also challenged for the [[CZW World Heavyweight Championship|CZW Heavyweight Championship]]. He feuded with Zandig for the title and finally beat him in July 2000. He held the title until ''Cage of Death II''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/000909.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling - CZW Cage of Death II....After Dark September 9, 2000 - Sewell, NJ|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that show, Lobo successfully defended the championship against Zandig in the Cage of Death match. Directly following this match, Justice Pain came out and fought Lobo in another Cage of Death match. In the match, Lobo was thrown from the top of the cage to the ground through a table covered in barbed wire. Justice Pain went on to win the match and the title.&lt;ref name=&quot;Online World of Wrestling&quot;/&gt;  After losing the title, Lobo continued feuding with Zandig. This time, the feud was for ownership of CZW. On February 9, 2002, Lobo defeated Zandig to become the new owner of CZW. He held this position until ''Cage of Death IV'' when Zandig defeated him to regain his position as CZW's owner &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/021213.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling December 13, 2002 - Philadelphia, PA - Viking Hall|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2003-present===
He took some time off from CZW following the Cage of Death match. While he was gone, a new group called the Hi-V tried to take over CZW, with Zandig as their main target. Zandig was planning to face the Hi-V at ''Cage of Death V'', but the stable outnumbered his team 6 to 4. At ''Night of Infamy II'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/031115.html|title=Night of Infamy II - November 15, 2003 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lobo made a shocking return to help Zandig and join his team just in time for Cage of Death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/031213.html|title=Cage of Death V December 13, 2003 - Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their team was successful. In February 2004, Lobo became the first inductee to the CZW Hall of Fame. After this, Lobo remained inactive for the following two years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Online World of Wrestling&quot;/&gt;

At [[Cage of Death 7]], [[Zandig]], who had turned on the fans, wanted to run CZW the way they used to. He called out Lobo, who was backstage for the event, and they joined each other along with [[Justice Pain]] and [[Nick Gage]]. They would later call themselves the Forefathers of CZW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/_2006/|title=2006 results

*'''Speedy Delete''' - for blatant advertising.  I waited a bit to see how this one would play out before making a decision, but as much good faith as I normally assume, there is no sticking up for this one.  The article's [[User:Kobius|prime editor]] (and incidentally, the forum admin) removed the AfD tag from the page and does not take kindly to other editors touching 'his' page.  The whole layout of the article is clearly trying to draw viewers into the forums, perhaps to meet the admitted goal of 500,000 posts.  Add these to the issues others have pointed out and there's really no need for further discussion.

The Anizone is a large site and I think if someone wants to find out more about it they come to the best internet dictionary in the world and they research on of the largest best sites. The site has a largely amount of fair people considering it has been hacked three times. The admin accidently remoe it thinking it would be delete and he was not the maker of the page but it was I.

==BBC News Report and the pilot &quot;looking for a good place to crash&quot;==

The BBC article states that the pilot was looking for a good place to put the aircraft down; he missed some park and instead put the aircraft down in an uninhabited area near Stockport city centre. The evidence does not justify this supposition whatsoever. For one thing, the AIB report states that the aircraft was likely uncontrollable after the engines cut out, and might not have been controllable even before then. The first officer died and the captain suffered retrograde amnesia, so we don't know what went on in the cockpit. There isn't the tiniest shred of evidence that the pilot &quot;put the aircraft down&quot; someplace safe. It was likely just coincidence - there are a lot of empty or disused areas around airports and under approach paths (and *that* is often deliberate).

This is such a common urban legend/media foofah. Every time a plane doesn't actually fall out of the sky, some media type comes up and says the pilot was &quot;looking for a place to crash that wouldn't cause injuries on the ground&quot;. I don't blame the Wikipedian who put this in at all, because he/she likely didn't have any sources other than the BBC article. I am blaming the BBC for making a supposition not supported by the facts.

I suppose people want to think that in an emergency the first thing the pilot will do is look for a safe place to crash. It makes them feel less worried about an aircraft crashing into their home, school, or place of business. It ain't necessarily so, though; in fact it almost is never so. Aircraft about to crash are more often than not uncontrollable - that's why they crash. --[[User:Charlene.fic|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot; face=&quot;Matisse ITC&quot;&gt;Charlene&lt;/font&gt;]] 19:40, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

Edited to add: The cause of the accident wasn't &quot;pump failure&quot; (boo, BBC, again). It was a design error in the fuel line. --[[User:Charlene.fic|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot; face=&quot;Matisse ITC&quot;&gt;Charlene&lt;/font&gt;]] 20:02, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

:Apologies. That would have been my factual faux pas. Thank you for correcting my blathering and making this article respectable. :) [[User:Legion89|Legion]] 13:56, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

A second's more flight and the plane would catastrophically have taken the tower off Stockport's fine Town Hall and crashed into the facade of the (then) infirmary opposite the Town Hall, blocking the main road between that runs from Manchester through Stockport to the south - AG, Stockport.

== Additional cause of this crash ==

I remember seeing a BBC program about this crash. It reported on the findings of the inquiry. It said that there was an additional reason for the crash.

Apparently, the engine speeds were shown in the cockpit on two dials, one for each wing. Each dial had two hands, one for each engine and each labelled with the engine number.

This had been serviced, and a mistake had been made so that engine 3 was connected to the hand marked &quot;4&quot;, and engine 4 to hand &quot;3&quot;.

I think it was engine 4 that was starved of fuel. The pilot saw from the dial that engine 3 had stopped, so he switched off / feathered engine 3. Now both engines on the right wing were out. (This would explain why engine 4 was windmilling.)

As part of the investigation, they tried flying a similar aircraft with engines 3 and 4 both out, and discovered that the aircraft could not be flown properly.

Now, I mention all this because it is an interesting story. Also, because I want to apply the moral to setting up a computer cluster. I want to avoid the possibility of one computer failing and a different one being taken out for service by mistake, thereby bringing down the cluster. 

Does anyone know more about this? [[User:Mm67|Mm67]] 11:44, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

==Is [[Wikipedia:Notability (science)]] a consensus guideline?==
Please state your position, '''yes''' or '''no''', explain your position and defend it.  This is not a vote.  [[User:SmokeyJoe|SmokeyJoe]] 10:47, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Yes''' I consider it one, and I'm not sure what objection people have - if there's a problem that needs fixing, let's fix it.  I already refer to it, guideline or not, since it's very useful.  --[[User:Minderbinder|Minderbinder]] 12:38, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Yes''' Not only is it a consensus guideline, it is absolutely vital for Wikipedia to have such a guideline. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 12:51, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Yes''' I certainly support this guideline, what it is trying to do, and how it is trying to achieve it. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:10, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Yes''' We're ready to go into the stage where changes should be discussed here before being implemented in the policy page. ~ [[User:Trialsanderrors|trialsanderrors]] 17:40, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Absolutely''' We've numerous AfDs and arbcom cases which have documented that this is the community's intent. --[[User:EngineerScotty|EngineerScotty]] 17:44, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* I don't see where the proposed criteria add meaningful advice to writters or evaluators, and the preamble/text is way too long to be practical.  Please cite some examples of AfD where this proposal would have ensured an outcome other than what would have been achieved under the current guidelines.  For each of the criteria now listed I belive that proper application of WP:N and WP:ATT would acheive the same results.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 17:54, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
** There is [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Electric universe (concept)]], where this standard helped to refine the arguments that finally got the topic removed.  The aupporters trying to use this guideline to buoy their cause ended up only showing all the more that the article did not belong in Wikipedia.  &lt;br&gt;You are correct that in the end articles that are removed will be so removed (or not) due to policy concerns.  The need for this guideline comes from its ability to focus the debate on the issues that are important in the relevant cases.  In other words, it helps to achieve the &quot;proper application&quot; that you are claiming makes this guideline irrelevant. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 18:22, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
*** EMS, could your purpose be acheived with an essay?  Among the problems with permutations from guidelines and policies is the evolution into redundant and conficting guidance to the point that writers and evaluators become confused and the branches work at cross purposes.  My frequent analogy is the US Tax Code, which has bread several large industries for interpretation and application.  Writing complex rule sets requires great skill and caution. --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 18:34, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
*** On review of the Electric universe (concept) AfD, it appears to be resoundingly rejected with the tools we already have, most convincingly original research and few reliable sources.  This outcome is consistent with other scientific and academic issues which I have seen defeated at AfD. An excellent nomination doesn't hurt either! --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 18:42, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
**** Right now I am wondering what your agenda is here, as this type of opposition usually comes from someone who has lost an AfD in part due to this and the guidelines and is seeking to water down the standards.  One of the factors that helped with the electric universe AfD was the the nominator was also working on this guideline and used its insights in writing the nom.  Beyond that, there is the basic issue of moving beyond &quot;peer review&quot; as a standard for inclusion, a test passed by numerous non-notable articles that I have seen.  Also, I at least have gone to some pains to couch this as a setting standard for inclusions instead of exclusion.  That way, an argument that &quot;X calls for inclusion&quot; renders this guideline moot as a refutation, and so avoids the types of conflicts that in our laws make being a lawyer such a profitable profession. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 19:16, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
***** My agenda is not as you assert, but your question is a fair one, which I will answer.  My agenda is clarity in the grand scheme of notability guidelines, without a specific prejudice to this proposal. Please visit the discussion page for WP:N to see that there are many people expressing concerns over the whole process.  I support the concept of &quot;encyclopedic suitability&quot;, which we call notablility at WP, for lack of a better name.  I also consider myself a moderate inclusionist.  I am a frequent participant in Afd.  You are correct in one respect, that I origninally became involved in AfD and notability, because I saw too many abuses by uninformed editors who were deleting meanigful articles, though not specifically in the field of science.  My interest is in history and sailing.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 19:33, 16 March 2007 (UTC) 
******Might I recommend that your &quot;no&quot; comment seems to be motivated more by a general dislike for [[WP:N]] rather than a specific distaste for this particular guideline. In particular, the motivation behind this guideline was in part due to a charge made during the [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Pseudoscience|Pseudoscience arbitrartion case]] that such a guideline should exist to fend off charges related to whether an idea was notable in a scientific sense. One can argue whether [[WP:N]] should exist or not, but that's not for us to decide here. It is absolutely not true that this guideline is redudant: there is no other place where it is indicated what makes a scientific idea notable for inclusion in the encyclopedia. [[WP:NOR]] doesn't help because &quot;originality&quot; is a vague concept related to heavily to [[WP:V]] and [[WP:COI]] to be useful when people just make random articles about ostensibly scientific subjects they read about online, for example. [[WP:A]] doesn't help because there are scientific ideas which are not notable (the general consensus of the community is that they do not belong in the encyclopedia) which nevertheless are attributable to reliable sources. [[WP:NPOV]] doesn't work because the exclusion criteria at [[WP:NPOV#Undue weight]] is unable to distinguish between majority and minority except by [[WP:CON|consensus]]. That's why this guideline is needed and why it is used. Look at all the pages that link here and tell me that it isn't referred to. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 13:09, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
* No, it's not.  I think the burden of some evidence that this guideline is widely supported and necessary needs to be shown from the supporters.  Right now it's an initiative, a proposal with stable wording.  However, even in the &quot;test cases&quot; that I looked at, it seems that this guideline isn't being referred to, and evaluation of the articles in question isn't done with these guidelines in mind, rather, articles are mainly evaluated from a point of view of adequate sourcing and original research issues, in other words, policies we already have.  (I do think the editors here have reached a reasonably stable consensus, though.  But that doesn't, to me, make a &quot;consensus guideline,&quot; which implies support from the community overall.)[[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:04, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
**The evidence is in the ''What links here'' tool you can access from the toolbox. I think that you may have a hidden agenda here: you tend to be a bit too quick to agree to a supression bias against non-experts in the fields of science. Is this a misplaced concern? --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 13:09, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
***First of all there are over 150 things that link to [[Wikipedia:Notability (science)]], so it's not unreasonable to expect evidence to be actually gathered by someone trying to make a case.  But more, I went to a few of those &quot;what links here&quot; and apparently the only reason they were linked was that trialsanderrors mentioned that the debate was a test case: not people actually referring to the guideline and trying to use it.  Look at the Electric Universe AfD, for instance, which is the best example I've seen of a borderline-notable scientific theory (where this guideline might help).  [[WP:SCIENCE]] was not used as an argument in the debate, even by you, and the arguments that led to it being deleted were not even much along the lines of what is presented here in the guideline, but were according to core Wikipedia policies like [[WP:ATT]], [[WP:OR]] and so on.  Some of the argument is covered here in the introduction, but the &quot;criteria&quot; part played no role and seems to be central to this as a notability guideline.  So, this is what I mean when I say that no evidence has been presented.  What do YOU mean when you say this is a consensus guideline?  [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:43, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
****The criteria part played a huge role. The only criteria that EU could have come close to satisfying was recognition in popular culture/outside media and we showed that it was not notable along those lines. The guidelines at the time were being formulated and weren't as clear as they are now, but thanks to discussions such as that AfD we have a clearer demarcation. I think you need to read through the AfD we reference again and look carefully at how the criteria line-up with the criteria outlined in this guideline. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:02, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
*****Could you show me precisely where?  I don't mean to be dense, but I really don't see it.  I see your point #5 in the nomination, but that sounds like the core [[WP:N]] argument, and not related to the criteria here.  And anyway, saying the the EU debate influenced [[WP:SCIENCE]] kind of precludes that the EU debate can be thought of as evidence that this is a consensus guideline.  Can you show me ANY AfD debate that explicitly references the criteria?  [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:17, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
******Number 5 in the nomination. While it doesn't explicitly reference this page, it does so implicitly (and if I recall correctly at the time the standards were still being developed as to which criteria were going to be grouped with which). --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:20, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
*******Again, #5 was really along the lines of basic [[WP:N]].  Again, show me any debates that explicitly reference the criteria.  There's a difference between this proposal being wise or balanced or sensible and it having ''broad community support.''  [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:44, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
********Basic [[WP:N]]&quot;? That's a bit of WikiLawyering I haven't come across before. The fact is that #5 has direct parallels to our criteria here. You can thrust your head in the sand over this all you want, but that's the plain truth of the matter. And now you reposition your attack to claim that there isn't &quot;broad community support&quot;, but let me remind you that arbcomm members entreatied the community to develop these standards in the first place and that by virtue of this being a Wiki it will end up as balanced and sensible as possible. I'm beginning to think you are being a stick-in-the-mud for reasons you aren't coming clean about. Help me out, explain to me why you always seem to be fighting against scientific accuracy at Wikipedia so I can [[WP:AGF|assume good faith]] towards your contributions. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 17:36, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
***I suggest you go read [[WP:AGF]] and actually take it to heart.  In our current discussion, you seem to have trouble differentiating between (1) my personal support or opposition of the proposal and (2) my arguing that the proposal isn't a &quot;consensus guideline&quot;, that is, that it doesn't have broad support.  This wouldn't be a very hard difference to understand if you had been assuming good faith of me in the first place.  For the record, I support some of what the proposal says but not all of it, but that wasn't the basis for my objections: calling the proposal a &quot;consensus guideline&quot; is wrong, because this is still a very new proposal, barely even stable enough to judge.  [[WP:PROF]] remained a proposal for a very long time, and finally became a guideline when it became apparent that the guideline had influenced the way decisions were being made, and that the community, de facto, embraced the guideline.  Creation of policies and guidelines is slow and for good reason, especially when actionable changes are being proposed (like the criteria here).

****I appreciate your candor regarding your opinions of the content of this guideline because that is precisely what concerns me. However, I do feel that you are being a bit oblique in your commentary. &quot;Policy creation is slow,&quot; is often the cry of those who want to slow things down, and people tend to drag their feet for a reason. To me and many of the other editors who commented above, this guideline is ''de facto'' in place and isn't a proposal because we as editors abide by it. As you know, Wikipedia policies and guidelines are not written to affect change in the encyclopedia, but rather are meant to describe what actively goes on in editing. A good number of those who say that this is a consensus guideline edit a lot of science-related articles and so should be the ones to tell whether or not this guideline applies. I don't see that you are actively doing this as such. I do see you stepping into disputes regarding science-related articles often, and there are many times I see these actions as being in something of a contravention of the guidelines outlined here. I am being very up-front about my distrust of your motivations, but in so doing I'm also trying to assume good-faith as much as I can. Part of assuming good-faith is being transparent about one's perceptions and I'm offering you the opportunity to explain yourself as transparently as possible so we can move on. I don't like being lectured about [[WP:AGF]] when I was the one who brought it up, it looks to me like you are asking me to turn a blind eye towards our long history here at the encyclopedia and I am honestly telling you I'm having a hard time doing it because of the nature of this particular dispute we're having. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 13:53, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
*****You are making false implications about me, and I want it to stop.  [[WP:CIV|Comment on my comments]].  You say this is an attempt to document how Wikipedia works?  I respectfully disagree -- this talk page and its archives are full of debates about what the criteria ''should'' be, with very little discussion or analysis of how things are actually decided now.  (Some, but not much.)  From perusing the test cases, it seems to me that people are nearly exclusively deciding on these cases on the basis of [[WP:OR]], [[WP:ATT]], and [[WP:NPOV]], (and to a degree, [[WP:N]]), without much need for arguments specific to issue that the topics under discussion are scientific ones.  Since that ''isn't'' the content of this proposal, I cannot agree that this is documenting current Wikipedia practice, but if you want to try to change my mind, please show me specific examples so we can discuss them.  In any case, you should advertise this debate on [[WP:VPR]]; the general Wikipedia community should have a chance to comment.

******Whether they are false or not, they are simply my questions regarding your, frankly, obstinate resistance to this particular document. I am trying to be as forthright as possible here, and your increasingly haughty responses only confuse me further since you still haven't addressed directly my concerns regarding the history we have surrounding issues such as this. I disagree that the discussions are centering around how things &quot;should&quot; be. Rather I see discussions centering around generalizing from the experience that editors have. You also seem to be under the opinion that just because people reference older and more established policies and guidelines they aren't also considering this guideline. This I find to be particularly problematic because it ignores the words of people that aren't appended with a WP-acronym. Just because somebody doesn't cite this directly doesn't mean that you can't see the criteria being applied (as per our earlier discussion on EU deletion). I would hope that you would look more closely at the deletion discussions surrounding this and see if you can't spot the criteria in action. I am not going to advertise the debate anywhere, but you are free to do so. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 16:27, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
*******I've advertised the debate at [[WP:VPR]].  In terms of the status: you see one thing, I see another thing.  I'm not going to change my opinion by simply being told &quot;please look more closely,&quot; although you could convince me if you actually showed me some evidence.  I do see a lot of attempts at guiding the community: take a look at [[#&quot;Conference topic&quot; is a backdoor]], for instance, or [[#One final thought]]: people are discussing how to make a good rule, not what the rule is, organically.

****I'm with SA here: [[WP:N]] is being criticized partly because of its extreme generality.  No reason to think the entire idea of notability for all topics must pause just because of that.

****  The problem lies less with any individual sub-guideline, but more with a plethora of permutations leading to confusion.

***** I don't see any bedlam here.  I see this as being a well crafted guideline that is dealing with issues which are out-of-scope for the more general guideline due to its broad nature.  This guideline deals with the issues of science and science-related topics, and how to implement the notability guidelines within that context.&lt;br&gt;I have looked at the [[WP:N]] discussion and I get the feeling that you are doing your best to create uncertainty and confusion there.  And now you are trying to do the same here.  I for one have no need for it, and support this guideline as a reflection of the legitimate sense of the science editors here as to what is valid. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 18:23, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
*Yes, this appears to be a consensus guideline. The opposition to this guideline proposal may be part of a campaign in which User:Kevin Murray in the past month has placed &quot;rejected&quot; , &quot;disputed&quot; , or &quot;historical&quot; , or &quot;essay&quot; labels on about a dozen notability proposals or guidelines or has nominated them for deletion on the grounds that there was no consensus or that they constituted &quot;instruction creep&quot; or were redundant. A proposal is not necessarily impossible to reach consensus upon just because a few editors oppose it.

** I see your point.  This editor really, really has a grudge against the concept of notability, and I would love to know why.  If you want to do a [[WP:RfC]] against him, I am will be happy to second it.  This is ridiculous. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 19:42, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
*** No EMS, this editor, has a &quot;grudge&quot; against needless and redundant rule making for the sake of rule making.  I strongly support the concept of encyclopedic suitability which we call &quot;notability&quot; at WP.  This is not &quot;ridiculous&quot; but based on observations from life experience, that too many conficting rules create confusion rather than clarity.  Complex rule-sets require incredible cross coordination among the permutations, which is not happening here at WP, as guidelines are multiplying like rabbits without consideration of the big picture.  If you propose an RfC, please do so in the best interest of WP, not &quot;against&quot; me; this is not personal and reviewing the discussions will reveal that my actions are well supported.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 14:18, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
****There are plenty of Wikipedians who [[WP:IAR|agree with you about hating rules]]. However, might I suggest that you are going about it the wrong way. We are here writing this guideline because we need to summarize what has been done in regards to this issue. Your own personal distaste for the way in which editors have gone about doing this is probably best argued elsewhere: it certainly has nothing to do with whether consensus exists for this particular guideline. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:29, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
*** I do not see '''any''' need to coordinate this guideline with any other guidelines beside [[WP:N]] itself.  Although I am doing my own &quot;[[WP:NOR|original research]]&quot;, I have seem enough -uh- &quot;stuff&quot; offered by others such that I see a need to draw a firm and reasonable as to what is and is not acceptable here.  Until it has some reasonable amount of recognition in the scientific community, I see an article on my ideas as being an abuse of Wikipedia.  Yet I am unusual in that most other editors of Wikipedia with alternate ideas are here to promote those ideas, and they hate guidelines like this one with a purple passion because they help to keep their OR out.&lt;br&gt;BTW - I do see where you have had some success with you anti-Notability campaign.  Personally I think that you are doing Wikipedia a real disservice with it, and what you are stifling is not a bunch useless rule-making but instead needed elaborations on the meaning of Notability in various domains.  As has been noted in [[Wikipedia_talk:Notability|the WP:N discussion]], there is a level of subjectiveness in determining notability.  The need for these subsidary guidelines is to limit that subjectiveness, and thereby make this concept more usable.  Instead you are trying to pull the rug out from under Notability, something that will make the removal of questionable material much more difficult than it should be. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 16:08, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''the real test''' is whether the guidelines here will be accepted in practice. Both the above positions are to some degree correct: the guideline should reflect what its eds. believe to be the common feeling of the community, but it shouldalso point in the direction of where the consensus appears to be moving, and to be making recommendations from those most involved in edited these articles to guide thos less familiar. I think it will prove to be accepted because it is relatively straightforward, not complex -- at least by comparison -- and, in my view it does reflect the general voice. But we shall see. 
::The real dispute , I think, is over the notability of fringe science and whether that can be considered science in any sense at all. This is a matter in which I think there is in fact no real consensus, but at best a temporary majority, and i expect this  question to continue to be the theme of AfDs. I don't think this guideline  lays it to rest '''[[User:DGG|DGG]]''' 23:36, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
::: This guideline cannot and should not judge whether something is &quot;real science&quot;.  In fact, all that a determination that something is &quot;not science&quot; can do here is to remove a topic from being judged by this criteria with no resolution on its notability or lack thereof.  IMO, we have a set of criteria here such that anything that is meant to be judged as part of science can be ruled on here, be it mainstream or fringe.  What I think that you will find is that the least palatable topics are those which also have had the least impact and are also therefore the least notable.  --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 01:53, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

== Some suggestions on organizing this project page ==

* The introduction is too long.  Limit it to &quot;what&quot; and &quot;why&quot;.  Get the commentary (i.e. &quot;impetus&quot;) and discussion of process into its own section.  Specifically address what makes ''science'' different from other areas covered by the general guidelines.
* Criteria should define at least these categories as guidance to editors:
** topics which on their face should be include (i.e. the notable)
** topics which are going to require some judgments to be made by editors if they are new articles or added to existing articles. (i.e. the maybe notable)
** topics which, at least according to the authors of the guideline, are ''improbably'' included. (i.e. nonnotable)
* The statement ''&quot;Decisions about including or excluding material must always reflect the opinions of outside authorities, not those of Wikipedia editors.&quot;'' is bizarre because the opinion of Wikipedia editors is what, by definition, compose the Wikipedia. ''&quot;Must always&quot;'' is a rather strange term to be found in a mere ''guideline'' at any rate. [[User:Patsw|patsw]] 13:22, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

:: If you wish to draft an alternate version, the feel free to do so ''elsewhere'' and present it to us as a possible replacement.  We are certainly amenable to productive changes.  However, IMO the current project page works and should be considered a functioning guideline. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:13, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
:I agree the ''reflect outside authorities'' wording is odd (although not any odder than &quot;notability is not subjective&quot; which expresses the [[WP:ATT|same sentiment]]). The rest doesn't strike me as an improvement. ~ [[User:Trialsanderrors|trialsanderrors]] 17:49, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

::One point that isn't being made (in the intro) and probably should be is the point that scientific theories cannot be properly presented without understanding their level of acceptance.  There's a big difference between a mainstream theory and a fringe theory, and even in an article about a fringe theory, it's important to describe it as one.  However, for some fringe theories, insufficient sources exist to back up the claim that they are fringe theories.  Thus we are left with only one real choice: disallow the article, as we cannot properly cover it while adhering to [[WP:ATT]] and [[WP:NPOV]].  This is different from, say, an article about a band, where it may be that no source reports on their popularity or number of fans accurately, but sources do report on other things: the information we can't cover can just be left out.  In articles on science, we really can't leave that out.  [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:41, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

:::The &quot;level of acceptance&quot; argument makes no sense to me. &quot;Theory&quot; in science has a very precise meaning which applies to models and descriptions which are as completely accepted as possible in an endeavor based primarily on the dubious activity of inductive reasoning. While there is a big difference between mainstream and fringe proposals, the proposals themselves are only considered &quot;theories&quot; when they pass the tests of the scientific method. What makes a proposal fringe is, ostensibly, its inability to pass these tests. This doesn't mean that scientists don't make mistakes in pejoratively labeling the fringe out of the mainstream, only to say that the level of acceptance is something of a binary operator: either it's in or it's out. When an idea does not generate enough interest in the scientific community to create commentary from members of the community, it must either be uncontroversial (as is the case with textbook knowledge) or it must be outside the scientific community. This is quite easy to verify. No amount of posturing and insisting on the part of a fringe idea's proponents that the idea is actually &quot;scientific&quot; is good enough when demarcating for our purposes. We might still have articles on the idea if there is &quot;extra-scientific&quot; interest in it, but we do not need to shy away from being honest about its &quot;extra-scientific&quot; nature. One of the problems that many pro-fringe editors have is that they believe that because [[negative proof|proving the negative]] is in principle a defiance of [[WP:ATT]] that reasonable editors can't make editorial judgments with regards to the status of a particular idea. This is simply not the case at all: we are editing an encyclopedia not compiling a list of sources. After all, that's why we have editors in the first place: we are charged with summarizing the available data in the most conformist way possible. When all the data is outside the scientific community and the idea purports to have scientific importance, it is perfectly fine to delineate the contradiction. However, this discussion is probably better suited for [[WP:FRINGE]]. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:09, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

*I think it is a little more complicated than that.
*It is not ''necessary'' to give an indication of the acceptance of a theory, in order to describe it.
*And I don't think the word &quot;theory&quot; has such a precise meaning as scientists would like. For example, Wikipedia calls the [[Big Bang]] a &quot;theory&quot;, whereas the Encyclopedia Britannic calls it a &quot;Model&quot;. And I am sure there are more sources supporting both.
*This is why the new [[WP:A]] is so important. I can attribute both the Big Bang Theory, and the Big Bang Model, but I can find no source which agues it must be one or the other.
*I can also find no attribution labelling many minority subjects as &quot;fringe&quot;, nor claiming a certain level of acceptance. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 17:47, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

== Making this an approved guideline ==

I notice that Kevin Murray has downgraded this guideline back to the &quot;proposed&quot; status.  I would revert that myself, except that I am not at all clear by what action/authority it became considered a functioning guideline.  Certainly the above poll has produced only five people who support this as a guideline.  Even without the two nay-sayers I fail to see how the five of us constitute a group that can speak for the Wikipedia community as a whole, or at least the science editors.

I for one do call for the issue of approving this as a functioning guideline be presented to the community as a whole.  [[Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)|the Village Pump policy forum]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Science|WikiProject Science]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Physics|WikiProject Physics]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Chemistry|WikiProject Chemistry]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Biology|WikiProject Biology]] are all places where this guideline can be advertised and input and approval sought.  I see little danger in this and much promise, but mostly I would like to be able to show Kevin a formal approval so that is downgrading of this guideline cannot occur again. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 02:17, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

::We don't do &quot;formal&quot; and &quot;official&quot; with respect to guidelines. What matters is if this is (1) a good idea and (2) used as such in practice.

Judged by this talk page and AFD, the answer to all three is 'yes', so this page is a de facto guideline and Kevin is the lone dissenter here. Of course, putting a notice on the village pump never hurts.

:::Kevin is not the only dissenter, I also am.  Let me enumerate some general criticisms, this time relating to the substance of the proposal.  1.  There is not a big need for this.  Most science articles up for deletion are up for other concerns than notability, primarily, concerns that the article is original research, POV, or inadequately sourced.  Although there are many debates on the test pages subpage, in very few was the critical issue the notability of the subject: [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Electric universe (concept)]], [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Socionomics]], and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Growing Earth Theory]] (and the old debates, not listed there, about [[Time Cube]]).  2.  The list of criteria, a core part of this proposal, were not used as the basis of successful arguments in any of the key examples I listed.  Rather, the test seems to be the general one of being covered in multiple independent sources, inside or outside of the scientific community.  Note that the criteria give an opportunity to supporters of OR articles (real OR, not neutral attempts at describing published research) to argue for inclusion inappropriately: see [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sorce theory]] as an example of this.  The criteria have changed since then, but the same kind of argument could be made today.  I wouldn't want to jeopardize any of those debates by having a guideline here with such minimal applicability.  3.  The list of criteria is instruction creep and isn't useful.  For articles that should be deleted, not meeting the criteria doesn't make a strong argument.  For articles that should be kept, they're okay, but arguments to delete things that meet these criteria are weak delete arguments in the first place, usually along the lines of &quot;this article is in bad shape&quot;, see [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ubiquitous computing]] for example.  The criteria seem aimed at solving a non-existant problem of the over-deletion of notable science topics.

*The fundamental flaw of [[WP:SCIENCE|Notability (science)]], is that it tries to determine only whether an article is '''scientifically''' notable. It does not consider whether an article may be notable in '''any''' other area.

*: This is a true red herring IMO.  A failure of scientific notability does not mean that an article may have notability in another manner and therefore be worthy of inclusion.  I did have wording here to that effect at one time, but it seems to have been lost.  I will see to restoring that, as I see this guideline as being usable only as a means of inclusion.  For the purposes of exclusion, the failure of a topic to merit inclusion under any guideline (including this one) is the relevant matter. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:27, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
*:  (Edit conflict) Agree with EMS; The page clearly embraces the idea that popular notability for science topics is appropriate.  Since popular notability definitely is acceptable (see the [[Time Cube]] precedent, for instance), any wording that implies otherwise should be examined.  But you aren't correctly representing the main thrust of the proposal.

::*I did not suggest that failing scientific notability means that an article MUST be notable elsewhere. I wrote that it MAY be notable elsewhere. Yet the current policy does not consider this.
::*Deleting articles based on scientific notability alone, is an incredible conceit, and should play no part of the proposed guidelines. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 17:35, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
:::*I'm not sure what your point is.  If an article is scientifically notable, fine, it's keepable.  If an article is not notable scientifically, but notable in some other way (for example, in popular culture), fine, it's keepable.  But if the article is not notable in any way at all, why should it be kept?

::::*A number of articles have already been deleted, based on whether they were scientifically notable only, or worse, ''mainstream'' scientifically notable.

:::::* So what?  I see this as something that can and should happen.  If no other grounds are being offerred to justify notability, then the article should go.  I would point out that the deleted items cited as being &quot;non-mainstream&quot; are also considered &quot;non-notable&quot;, while other items have been kept as being &quot;notable&quot; but &quot;fringe&quot;.  It seems to me that this shows that this is a reasonable and workable scheme. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 22:09, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

::::::*No other grounds for notability are offered because the articles are considered only as to whether they are scientifically notable.
::::::*For example, the article on [[Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Ralph_Juergens|Ralph Juergens was deleted]] (a) based on a Scientific notability &quot;test case&quot; (b) on the grounds that he was a &quot;non-notable non-mainstream scientist&quot;, which is accurate, but no cause for deletion by itself.
::::::*It is improper for &quot;Notability (science)&quot; to '''solely''' judge any article for deletion, as it makes no attempt to attract expert editors in other fields --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 23:12, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

:::::::* If you are saying that a deleted article had another non-scince reason for being notable, then please name it and indicate why that reason was not considered at the time.  Also do note that in such cases a request for reconsideration can be made to [[Wikipedia:Deletion review]].  However, this standard is for determining notability with respect to science, and I find it to be quite silly and disingenuous to accuse this guideline of not doing something that it is not meant to so (namely seeking non-science-related reasons for inclusion). --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 01:56, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

::::::::* Ian, I hear you.  However your objections are ''way'' off base here, because what you don't like is that a consensus of Wikipedia editors has disagreed with your stance on certain topics.  That doesn't really have any bearing on whether or not that consensus exists.  You talk like [[WP:SCIENCE]] got Ralph Juergens deleted: no.  A consensus of editors and a discussion got it deleted, and frankly, it wasn't even based on [[WP:SCIENCE]] at all, more like on [[WP:BIO]] or [[WP:PROF]].

:::::::::*No, I am criticizing the make-up of the consensus, which is predominantly science-oriented editors who decided that Ralph Juergens was not notable because he was not a mainstream scientists; That is what the summary says. The AfD was not targeted outside of Notability (Science).
:::::::::*The main reason given for deletion of &quot;Ralph Juergens&quot; was that he &quot;is only published by vanity presses&quot;; not only is this false, but it fails civility guidelines,[[WP:COI#Importance_of_civility]]. Nevertheless, this was picked up by several other editors as their reasons for supporting the AfD.
:::::::::*But this is not the place to discuss a single article, but I offer this as an example. 
:::::::::*I think it is wholly inappropriate for WP:SCI to advertise articles for deletion. WP:NOTABLE should advertise AfD, giving a editors a chance to refer to WP:SCI and OTHER notability guidelines. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 10:46, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

==One researcher POV fails NPOV==
*The third paragraph includes an incorrect statement:
:&quot;the point of view of one researcher or research term and, unless it generates a significant outside response by the scientific community or the population at large, fails NPOV&quot;
*This is a complete misunderstanding of [[WP:NPOV|NPOV]]. If we attribute a statement to a single researcher, and it conforms to [[WP:A]] and is not misrepresented, then it conforms to NPOV. The argument is whether a statement by a single researchers is ''notable'', which is completely different. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 19:26, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

::*If another attributable view is available, we describe it. If it isn't, we don't pretend there might be one. There is no double whammy.
::*Describing the POV of one person does not automatically fail NPOV, and any decent editor can describe any POV in way that fulfils NPOV.
::*Quashing a POV on the grounds that there MIGHT be a hypothetical counter-POV, fails NPOV, fails WP:A, and fails WP:V. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 00:08, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

:::::*The only requirement to provide a balanced view, is if one exists. If it doesn't, then to pretend that a view &quot;needs balancing&quot;, is presumably based on the view of an unattributable, anonymous, expert-less editor. This fails numerous Wikipedia policies.

:::::*Yet both POVs are EQUALLY valid, as long as they are not misrepresented, and can easily be described in a manner that conforms to NPOV. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 13:15, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

:::::::What you fail to realize is that there is an informal community discussion as well as a formal publication discussion. Those who are in a particular community are aware of the informal discussion and are able to tell when a topic is ignored/scoffed or when it is accepted. This cannot be reported at Wikipedia for verifiability reasons, but it still raises NPOV concerns when certain editors try to force obscure research into the forefront of an article. You are mistaking a standard of verifiability (which is the standard for how to write an article) with editorial judgement: they need not be one-in-the-same. In other words, one need not &quot;verify&quot; that there is NPOV issues because, as editors, our editorial opinions do not need to be (nor can they be) verified. The only thing that needs to be verifiable is the text of the article. We are allowed to have judgements that are external to this. As such, it is perfectly reasonable to say that there are NPOV problems with someone citing a single, isolated, though published research paper. In terms of your dark matter red herring, you have totally misconstrued the situation, and I'm fairly confident that nearly any third party not firmly ensconced in pathological skepticism toward mainstream astrophysics would find your evaluation predictably myopic. Clowe's triumphalist attitude is only justified from the standpoint of [[standing on the shoulders of giants]]. It's not like he was publishing his &quot;proof&quot; of dark matter in a vacuum -- it was a particular point that was addressed to a particular (MOND-type) objection. However, when your hypothetical John Doe bucks the established research by publishing proof against dark matter, he is publishing in a vacuum. Prof. John Doe's work is marginal and therefore marginalized by Wikipedia. Clowe's work is mainstream and therefore reported by Wikipedia. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:47, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
::::::::SA is quite right about verifiability vs. editorial judgement.  However, I have to say I worry when editorial judgement of this type comes into dispute.  Wikipedia needs sources for two reasons: one is to have attributions in the articles, but another reason is that it levels the playing field in editorial discussions.  Inherently, experts on Wikipedia are not set above ordinary editors, but they may be more familiar with the subject in question.  But experts have to prove themselves, just like anyone else.  Fundamentally, Wikipedia is a community of equal editors.  So, this is a good argument ''for'' [[WP:SCIENCE]]: in order to avoid having to rely on editorial judgement too heavily, we look for a higher standard of quality in sources for scientific topics, and where that doesn't exist, we should avoid covering the subject.

:::::::::*Let's not mix up NPOV and editorial judgment. As I said earlier, the statement in the introduction is incorrect concerning NPOV. I also said it may concern notability, so I'm not dismissing the point. But let's be accurate as editors.
:::::::::*The idea that a community has informal discussions which a particular editor may be aware, is worthless. It is not verifiable, nor attributable. 
:::::::::*I know THREE different communities, all of whom have informal discussions, and promise peer reviewed papers that I could mention too. Also worthless.
:::::::::*An encyclopedia does not run on material gleaned from Chinese whispers via anonymous, unaccountable editors.
:::::::::*I had previously brought this up at the Neutrality Project, see &quot;[[Wikipedia_talk:Neutrality_Project#NPOV_misunderstanding|NPOV misunderstanding]]&quot;. They agree. A singular POV can be described in an NPOV manner. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 16:01, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

NPOV is inherently based in editorial judgement. The only way that someone determines whether there is a problem with NPOV is by making an editorial judgement. That's why the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{POV}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag comes with the wording it does. Disputes arise between editors over NPOV: if there was a singular editor there would never be NPOV issues from the standpoint of writing an article. While I agree with Mangojuice that editors are judged external to their status as &quot;experts&quot; (see ongoing conflicts over [[WP:EXPERT]] for example), the community doesn't deny the existence of experts either. No one is saying that the encyclopedia should be &quot;run&quot; on expert judgement or the whispers of whatever anonymous and unaccountable ethnic group, but people are saying that editors may come to the table with these concerns. That's the essence of the NPOV guideline: all the points-of-view are placed on the table and the marginalization happens per the outside community and references to the outside world. No one is saying that a singular POV cannot be described, but people are saying that singular POVs present unique difficulties when writing an encyclopedia that is supposed to be NPOV. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 17:39, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

:*Indeed, all the POVs are placed on the table. And if there is just one POV (because there is one WP:V/WP:RS/WP:A), then we can still write that POV so that it conforms to NPOV, regardless of whether you or I or anyone else agrees with the POV, and regardless of whether it is mainstream of pseudoscience.
:*In which case, the statement in the third paragraph that I described above, is incorrect. A view from a single researcher may fail a criteria, but there is no reason for it to fail NPOV; and if it does, any decent editor can re-write it so that it conforms to NPOV. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 19:19, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
:::If there is only one notable POV, then sure, we write about it. In which case the statement in the third paragraph is correct. A view from a single research written about on Wikipedia does have editorial issues related to NPOV for the reasons delineated because the alternatives may exist but cannot be included without falling into original research. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 19:23, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
::::*The statement is incorrect because a single POV does not fail NPOV unless it is written badly, in which case any competent editor can correct it. Sure, the statement may be allowed because it is notable. But it won't fail because of NPOV.
::::*A single POV that has been published elsewhere does not not fail &quot;Original research&quot;, because [[WP:NOR]] &quot;refers to '''unpublished''' facts&quot;. (my emphasis) --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 19:51, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

You are missing the point. Perhaps I should post here the statement that you dispute:

:''Research published in a reputable publication passes these thresholds but reflects the point of view of one researcher or research term and, unless it generates a significant outside response by the scientific community or the population at large, focusing on such research in a Wikipedia article does not adequately conform to [[WP:NPOV|Wikipedia's policy on neutrality]], in particular the section on [[WP:NPOV#Undue weight|undue weight]].''

You'll note that the point being made is that simply quoting published work is not good enough. Why isn't it good enough? Because unless the work in question has generated discussion it has not been vetted outside of Wikipedia to make it possible to write an article on the subject that adheres to the spirit and letter of NPOV.
--[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 20:36, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
::The POV of a single researcher in a single first-rate peer-reviewed publication, has normally been assessed by 2 or usually 3 independent scientists with a tendency to be ciritical. The assumption made by colleagues it that such results are correct unless proven otherwise. Are we supposed to be more critical of physics that he physicists who review for PRL? Then, if discussed by independent sources, as most scientific papers are, it is considered worth citing and commenting one. Reputable journals expect items listed as references to be relevant to the new work also. I'm a librarian. i think many articles in most library journals are basically trivial if not junk altogether.. But they are considered valuable by my colleagues in general, and its their trms that matter. I will judge by reporting theirs',  not imposing my own.'''[[User:DGG|DGG]]''' 09:02, 9 April 2007 (UTC)

:The statement which I quoted above, is as follows:
::&quot;the point of view of one researcher or research term and, unless it generates a significant outside response by the scientific community or the population at large, fails NPOV&quot;
:A single POV may fail, or being accepted by some other criteria. But a single POV does not fail NPOV (unless an editor writes poorly). 
:*To suggest that a statement based on a single POV, changes it's NPOV standing, depending on some other ''potential'' discussion whose view is yet to be determined, is illogical. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 20:46, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

If your point is that someone can attribute a single point of view in a fashion that is NPOV, that is absolutely correct. However, not every attributable point can be written about in a neutral fashion. An example of a quote that may be non-neutral though properly attributed and sourced is given at [[WP:FRINGE#Sourcing and attribution]]. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 00:01, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

:*Since describing a single POV can be achieved in an NPOV fashion, then the description in the third paragraph is incorrect which says that a single POV without response fails NPOV.
:*Judging/assessing a single POV is another matter altogether. But just because there may be no attributable assessments, does not make the description of a single POV automatically fail NPOV. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 00:34, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

I do not agree with the demand that not only must something be said in a respected peer reviewed journal, but that we must wait for other independent researchers to chime in, in OTHER respected peer reviewed journals, and agree with the first researcher that the claim is valid. The first post would constitute a reliable source satisfying [[WP:ATT]] and would be usable in a Wikipedia article. Similarly a book from a respected publisher would constitute a reliable source, without waiting for some other authority to write another book that says &quot;I agree with the first book.&quot; The demand places the bar way too high. It may be years before someone completely independent of the first researcher publishes the demanded blessing of the first researcher's claim. [[User:Edison|Edison]] 20:20, 9 April 2007 (UTC)

==[[Schmidt Sting Pain Index]]==
Can some of you knowledgable and discerning scientist Wikipedians take a look at this please? This article has currently been getting some coverage in popular &quot;gee whiz funny link of the day... how goofy!&quot; type blogs ( I hate it when this happens and the article in question is dubious... I think it gives a bad impression of wikipedia), but it seems to be mainly based on the idea that this one insect scientist guy wrote some goofy comments for an insect sting pain index one day. Ok, I agree that insect scientists are allowed to have senses of humour (WITHIN LIMITS, for the sake of us all), but I am concerned that 1) this scale is not really widespread and may be just one scale promoted by one guy without much acceptance in the insect expert community. 2) the pdf article linked which this wikipedia entry seems to be based on does not seem to say that Schmidt actually wrote those goofy comments. Its a bit ambiguous, but its seems to say that &quot;the media&quot; (without specifying what media) came up with the goofy comments to append to Schmidt's original dry scale(I think this may be another case where people exaggerate or misinterpret what an article is saying). I dont have any access to science journal databases, and am certainly no science or insect expert. But these concerns and quick scans of google books and google scholar led me to bring this issue to wiser heads. Thanks very much  for checking this out.

The index also has been mentioned in popular science pubs; though it doesn't appear to be taken seriously by scientists.  A scientifically-based pain index would be interesting (though I decline any offers to participate in such research); both this and the related Starr index appear to be little more than the opinions of the bug guys in question.  The article certainly dances on the edge of notability.  --[[User:EngineerScotty|EngineerScotty]] 05:30, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

******Ok, once again, in case anyone can actually respond on my point: the list of criteria here seems to be a misguided attempt to define reasons for notability that no one brings up in debates.  If the issue was the over-''deletion'' of science articles, having these criteria would make sense.  But it seems to me that the main thrust of this proposal is in the opposite direction.  These are just fodder for disagreement (see [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sorce theory]] for instance) and distract from the main point about the POV and OR issues involved in using only sources from a single author.

********Good: a direct response.  Two brief points: (1) Arbcom never asked for criteria, but they did encourage developing a guideline, which is different.  (2) The EU deletion debate looks very different to me - there, the argument was done from first principles and it worked very nicely, and it skirted around the edge of these criteria (no one ever talked about whether the EU concept was &quot;textbook science&quot; or had institutional support)... and as for extended discussions with Iantresman... I don't think the criteria will make one bit of difference, and that's not a very good reason anyway.  Long-winded debate... I don't think we should seek to avoid it as a general principle, debate is a good thing.  Criteria would simplify the job but scientific topics aren't exactly overwhelming the AfD lists.

== General notability guideline template ==
Since the general notability guideline is central to most sub-pages, someone came up with the idea of creating a centralized template which will be consistent among the permutations from WP:N.  Please see whether we can make this work here.  The text is meant to be fairly generic, but it may make sense to add text following the template for fine tuning, or help us to make the template more applicable if it is not reflecting the consensus for notability.  I certainly didn't get everything that I wanted, but I'm very happy to see the compromises that make this a fairly representive of the attitude of the project.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 01:12, 7 April 2007 (UTC)

==Merging [[Wikipedia:Notability (numbers)]]==
What are the thoughts on merging [[Wikipedia:Notability (numbers)]] into this guideline proposal?  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 19:15, 25 April 2007 (UTC)

I've added a brief section which is the meat from the numbers guideline.  This seems appropriately and neatly combined here.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 16:29, 15 May 2007 (UTC)
*It's a bad idea, as explained on the talk page of WP:NUM.

== Scope creep ==

I may be beating a dead horse here, but all the references to NPOV, proponents and advocacy make it seem like this is about pseudoscience/fringe science, and the discussion above seems to confirm it. As it tries to apply to specialised but uncontroversial science, not much of it bears any resemblance to reality. --[[User:Abu-Fool Danyal ibn Amir al-Makhiri|Abu-Fool Danyal ibn Amir al-Makhiri]] 02:29, 6 June 2007 (UTC)

== Proposal concerns (LV) ==
Note that I came here from a couple of AfDs which were trying to present this as policy criteria for an article's deleltion.  As I read down the line, I encountered several problems with the proposed guideline.  I apologize if any and all of the below have been covered in the Talk Archives, which I am not going to read now.

Problems that I have at present with the proposal:

*Introduction:
:* &quot;A topic that is acceptable under this guideline is an appropriate part of Wikipedia.&quot;
::Pretty sweeping blanket statement, to me.  No other Notability criteria I'm aware of suggests that &quot;if it passes this, it's in.&quot;  Indeed, it seems to violate the principle of a Guideline to me, which always limits itself to allow potential exceptions.  Further, each section usually defines which criteria are primary and which are secondary.
*Notability of topics related to science:
:*&quot;Decisions about including or excluding material must always reflect the opinions of outside authorities, not those of Wikipedia editors.&quot;
::I know this has been mentioned above, but I want to echo this concern:  Decisions about including or excluding material must always reflect the consensus of the Wikipedia editors.  Anything else beyond that is helpful clarification, or it becomes fodder for people to [[WP:IAR]].
::I'd feel much more comfortable with something like, ''&quot;Deicions about including or excluding material on a scientific basis ought to be supported by the opinions and stated facts of outside authorities, as per [[WP:RS|Wikpedia:Reliable Sources]].&quot;''  Start throwing 'musts' around in anything but policy (perhaps only unbreakable/unmodifiable policy) and you'll get a lot of irate editors, scientific or not.
:*&quot;Although publication creates verifiability and reputable journals are reliable sources, publication by itself is not a sufficient (and sometimes not necessary) standard for encyclopedic notability. Unpublished research fails no original research and often lacks verifiability, so it is unacceptable by policy. Research published in a reputable publication passes these thresholds but reflects the point of view of one researcher or research term and, unless it generates a significant outside response by the scientific community or the population at large, focusing on such research in a Wikipedia article does not adequately conform to Wikipedia's policy on neutrality, in particular the section on undue weight. This guideline clarifies how the Wikipedia community has applied NPOV to articles on scientific topics. It does however not apply to the inclusion of scientific research as authorative sources within articles. The criterion for such sources is not that they are notable, but that they are reliable.&quot;
::Wha?  Could this be any more complex?  I actually had to diagram this paragraph out to understand it.  My hypothesis is most editors will not.  Can't you simply say it is normally necessary to follow the general notability guidelines with respect to neutral, multiple, independent, verifiabile, reliable sources?  And if you do that, what is the point of this whole section - I'm seriously not understanding how this adds anything to present guidelines.
* Criteria / General
:*&quot;1. Widely cited. Papers covering the topic have been widely1 commented on in academic writing within the topic's field.
::2. Outside notability. The topic is notable due to significant coverage in reliable sources outside of academic publications.&quot;  
::So we want articles only commented upon widely by multiple academic sources, which also are commented on outside academic sources?  Seems pretty wide, to me.
::Aside from that, I know I read somewhere that Wikipedia is not just a general encyclopedia, but can cover articles appropriate to special subject encyclopedias as well.  Thus 2. might well fail, as most specialist encyclopedias I am aware of have many articles which would only be known inside the discipline the encyclopedia represents.
:*&quot;Notable topics which are primarily non-scientific... [etc.]&quot;
::Boy, I'm going to love the AfDs which try to define whether a topic is &quot;science&quot; or not trying to use this.  Not to mention the arguments you'll get whether or not cosmology (for example) has a scientific basis or not.  Not to mention you're setting up a criteria which is so subjective it will rarely-if-ever be able to objectively define where this guideline would be relevant or not.
::Also, you will get editors asking whether the guideline itself applies or not - something I don't think I've ever seen with any of the other specialty N's about the guideline ''itself''.  I don't need to know if Burpa-Cola has been covered in the Cola News and CNN, or if Billy Bob Arthbutnott has both parlimentary opinions as well as the Sun documenting his career to know that Corp or People:Politicians applies.
*Scientific terms
:Again, how does this get beyond neologisms in a way that Avoid Neologisms doesn't, aside from adding the words &quot;scientific literature&quot;?
*Numbers and Sources
:*&quot;1. Have professional mathematicians published papers on this topic?
::2. Is the sequence listed in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences? (In the case of sequences of rational numbers, does the OEIS have the sequences of numerators and denominators of the relevant fractions?)
::3. Do MathWorld and PlanetMath have articles on this topic?&quot;
:::This may be taken from WProj numbers, I don't know.  But are you stipulating that 2 and 3 are reliable sources? (The Sources section has exactly this same problem.  You're controlling what is considered a Reliable Source without allowing the Wikipedia community at large to define that.  I have a problem with that - if I were arguing Notability(Religion), I would not want it to say that the Bible is an authorized source and any other 'holy' texts by default would have to prove themselves.)
*Sources
:*&quot;Scientific discovery is often disconnected from public discourse, so standard methods of sourcing and verifying are not always applicable. A scientific topic which yields low hit counts in the Google test...&quot;
::That's nice.  The Google test is widely regarded as discredited anyway.  Yes, I know it's still used, but it's questionability is known.
::Also, verifying and sourcing is verfying and sourcing.  I believe what's being aimed at here is scientific notability may have a smaller and different base (with different types of sourcing) for inclusion than other forms of notability.  So why not say that?  Except that above you're demanding 'popular' coverage as well as academic.
:*&quot;Web (and library) searches should therefore be evaluated based on the quality rather than the quantity of the finds.&quot;
::Thus, you allow extreme subjectivity creep, unless you are going to make further instruction creep in what constitutes scientific quality.  (My Jung is better than your Freud.  My Hawking beats your Einstein.  My t test is better than your bean counting.)  Common sense might be able to dictate that, but science is full of periods of flying in the face of qualitative common sense and succeeding - because it's right.
:*&quot;The following is a list of sources with qualifications of their usefulness.&quot;
::Again, you're preaching what is and isn't acceptable as a source, without allowing the community consensus to decide this over time. 
:*&quot;Google, Yahoo.... [etc]&quot; 
::Uh, again, how is this any different from Google test?

Finally, may I invite you to consider that most notability guidelines are much less complex and much more tolerant of letting individual cases be decided as individual cases?  And I hope that the question about &quot;Have we reached consensus?&quot; is asking if you as the editors have reached consensus about what you want to present to the community as a whole, as opposed to &quot;Are we ready to make this policy ourselves?&quot;

It may seem like I'm pissing all over your proposal.  I hope it doesn't, because I'd like to see a Notability(Science) guideline.  But I want it to be one that's usable and used - I wouldn't do either with this, and I'd argue as need be when someone tries to use this as a vote justification (which will happen, whether you want it to or not.)  Sorry for the length of the diatribe.

The rejected tag is appropriate and should stand until there is adequate discussion here to demonstrate active interest in the proposal.

It looks like a number of the contributors here are no longer active at WP: Lantreman ws banned, BDJ and Science Appologist have quit, Minder Binder, Abu-Fool Danyal ibn Amir al-Makhiri, and Laughing Vulcan have not contributed substantially since June and at all since mid-July.   &lt;s&gt;Trials and Errors and Radiant are advocating reinstating this as a proposal&lt;/s&gt;, but I don't think that there are enough editors who see this as a need.

* What I see now is something that is so watered down and nebulous that it cannot act as a genuine policy.  If people want to revive this effort, then we need to return to a version like [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Notability_%28science%29&amp;oldid=117329647 this one] and work from there.  IMO, what happenned to this effort is that a number of people whose pet articles were running afoul of this proposed policy chose to get involved with the blatant intent to sabotage it and remove its impact on their work, and unfortunately succeeded in doing so.&lt;br&gt;IMO, there is a genuine need for a policy like this to clarify what &quot;notability&quot; and &quot;verifiability&quot; mean in the context of a science article, and how [[WP:UNDUE]] should be applied.  It may be that this is an issue that is best handled by the admins with the advice and consent of the community so that we can avoid the pitfalls of the past. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:49, 20 August 2007 (UTC)
*I see, if not frequent, so at least [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere/Wikipedia:Notability_%28science%29&amp;limit=500&amp;from=0 recurrent use] of this guideline/proposed guideline/essay, very much in keeping with the rather low number of science-related AfD discussions. Absence of discussion on the talk page certainly doesn't establish rejection. I agree with EMS that the two-item version is watered down beyond recognition of the original version, and I don't see any consensus for it. ~ [[User:Trialsanderrors|trialsanderrors]] 16:07, 20 August 2007 (UTC)
:: Per [[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines]]: ''&quot;A rejected page is any proposal for which consensus support is not present, regardless of whether there is active discussion or not. Consensus need not be fully opposed; if consensus is neutral on the issue and unlikely to improve, the proposal is likewise rejected. It is considered bad form to hide this fact, e.g. by removing the tag. Making small changes will not change this fact, nor will repetitive arguments. Generally it is wiser to rewrite a rejected proposal from scratch and start in a different direction.&quot;'' --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 16:14, 20 August 2007 (UTC)

::: It seems to me that a lot of work has gone into turning this into something that everyone can reject.

== Reverted to earlier version ==

I have reverted the article to the form of lat March, with some twaking of the lead and the first section.  The revised first section now has a simple first paragraph that states the need to this policy as succinctly as I can.  The next two paragraphs have had their order exchanged so that the farily dry &quot;relevance&quot; paragraph comes last.  The previous last paragraph has been removed as an unreadable mess.  (I believe I drafted that paragraph originally, but it really never worked as intended, and only got worse over time.)

The {{tl|rejected}} tag has been kept as a matter of form, with the {{tl|proposed}} tag just commented out but still present.  I for one would be happy to see this version go back to &quot;proposed&quot; status, but I want to see if others are on-board for doing that.  Let's just say that after having taken a rest, I am ready and willing to work towards acceptance of a functional version of this as a policy or guideline if others are. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 18:24, 20 August 2007 (UTC)

:Personally, I don't see a lot of point reviving this.  The criteria have always been an attempt to change practice rather than an attempt to document practice, and to most people, the criteria and the proposal are one and the same.  The criteria really haven't caught on, and from my experience, people rely on other policies for scientific topics, like [[WP:OR]] and [[WP:V]], and where notability is needed, the general [[WP:N]] seems to be sufficient and its use is accepted.

:: Having looked more closely at the edit history, I find that your attempt to streamline this two two items has met fairly stiff resistance.  Then again, that is little wonder since your proposed consolidation ends up being little more than a restatement of pre-existing policy.  The goal of this proposal is to set up guidelines that go beyond the current policies and which are adapted to the issues which are unique to science.  Wikiepdia has very much outgrown [[WP:NOR|&quot;No original research&quot;]] and the requirement to use [[peer review]]ed [[scientific journal|journals]].  What do you do with a source that is &quot;peer reviewed&quot; but where the peers are fellow followers of a [[fringe science|fringe theory]]?  What do you do about the use of [[Nature (journal)|Nature magazine]], which is highly respected but does not use peer review to help select its articles?  What do you make of a theory published in a respected scientific journals but on which noone has cared to comment except the author?  What do you do with the [[cold fusion]] controversy created by Pons and Fleishman back in 1987 which obviously is notable within science but which was never respected by it?  There will not be many of these to contend with, but when they do appear this guideline will be invaluable.
:::::Please excuse my comment here, but the article content of Nature is peer reviewed. Like some other journals, it has on rare occasions published things based on consensus of the key editors, without formal peer review. The news content is not, of course, just editorially prepared -- by the most careful people around. It was they who caught the similarity of the stem cell photos after the peer reviewers missed it.

:: You like to cite [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sorce theory]] as a place where this guideline did not work.  For that I solidly disagree.  That article's creator had to play all kinds of games with these criteria to make a case for keeping the article.  In the end, his attempts to make the article look acceptable only helped to do it in.  In context this is a farly powerful tool.  In addition, it is not going to do in fringe science articles.  For example, I helped by have an aritcle on a book by [[Halton Arp]] kept because it was noted within the field of astronomy and also gained some measure of attention from the public at large.  That press coverage (both scientific and popular) could establish notability as described here was helpful in that discussion. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 01:03, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

:::You might note that my reduction to two criteria stood for over two months without comment.  You may also note that coverage by press and by scientific sources were the criteria I left in place, since those are the only part of the criteria that are useful.  What I object to are the other criteria, like &quot;textbook science&quot; or &quot;popular belief&quot; that are redundant and provide loopholes for argumentative POV pushers.  Can you hypothesize an example where a topic is &quot;textbook science&quot; or has a &quot;prominent advocate&quot; or has &quot;institutional support&quot; where the topic would be acceptable for Wikipedia ''without'' significant coverage in independent, reliable sources, academic or otherwise?

::::I am not sure whether I agree with you or not. I certainly think that there are science articles that are best referenced by standard textbooks, particularly for articles that are at the level of high school or early university science. For example, we probably do not want to source a peer reviewed journal on [[density]] and we do not. Are textbooks reliable sources? If so we do not need to mention &quot;textbook science&quot;, but if they are not, we probable do. --[[User:Bduke|Bduke]] 03:09, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

::::::: As for the other criteria: you agree on 3 and 4.  6 is totally pointless, because none of the criteria would expire once met.  7 obviously must require sourcing to back it up or it's totally vacuous and anyone could claim it about anything.  And anything discussed in a legitimate textbook is already covered in a reliable source, and I highly doubt that we'd ever find a case where one textbook mentions a topic but absolutely no other sources do.  Yeah, I agree, if we pare it any further, the ''criteria'' say nothing more than [[WP:N]] does.. so maybe we should lose the criteria altogether, or just spend more time explaining the issues that arise in assessing the quality of sources, especially academic ones.

(unindent) I think that you have just made an excellent suggestions in calling for an explanation of how to assess the reliability and relevance of sources.  Given some of the issues I have had recently with the anti-relativists over at [[talk:Herbert Dingle]], this makes a lot of sense.  (In those discussions, at least one person would take anything that he could find from a &quot;peer reviewed journal&quot; as evidence of a conflict over relativity and the [[twin paradox]].  Said contributions come from almost unknown overseas journals and in another case a blatantly anti-relativity publisher.)  I would still keep the remaining criteria as a way of saying that those things are the primary hallmarks of scientific notability, while noting that other options for notability are not prohibited. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:20, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

:I believe that's better, but I still think we should remove the criteria.  The problem is, people always seem to conflate a notability guideline and its criteria, while all other text is ignored.  By not having criteria, we would force people to read the discussion about the reliability of scientific sources.  (Actually, come to think about it, &quot;Notability (science)&quot; may not be the best name.  What about &quot;Reliable sources (scientific)&quot;?)

:: The criteria don't exist for the benefit of those that would abuse them but instead for the benefit of those that are looking for good guidance on what is acceptable.  The creator of an article will invariably try to defend it against an AfD.  IMO, if the article's creator can make a case that their article is acceptable under this criteria and everyone agrees, then these criteria have done a service in helping people to make that decision.  Similarly, if people listen to the creator's case and conclude that it does not hold water, then the criteria will also have helped by focussing the debate on the relevant issues and helping to bring about the deletion.  So as I see it these criteria overall are helpful.  Besides, it really is in the absense of clear guidelines that you get the nastiest debates. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 19:01, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

(a) Notability, (b) reliability of a source, and (b) reliable of the facts in that source, are all quite different, and tell us how to describe information, not whether to include it. If Arp publishes some information in an obscure overseas publications, and Stephen Hawkins in in Nature, Arp's supporters will find his article more notable, and no less reliable. And if Hawkins is described in a textbook, then it tells us that his ideas have a wider readership, and neither are as popular as today's astrology column.  &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment was added by [[Special:Contributions/{{{IP|{{{User|84.244.165.174}}}}}}|{{{IP|{{{User|84.244.165.174}}}}}}]] ([[User talk:{{{IP|{{{User|84.244.165.174}}}}}}|talk]]) {{{Time|17:34, August 21, 2007 (UTC)}}}&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Abandon this as an unnecessary complication==

Whether a peer review journal, a textbook, a popular book, a university hosted website or a notable persons personal site  is sufficiently reliable, reputable, or secondary is probably best treated on a case by case basis, and in any case this is not a problem specific to science.

Are there any controversial articles that are better treated by Notability (science) than by WP:NOR, WPV, and WP:N?  I think not.  I think there are too many guidelines, especially where they overlap.  True science should only need to satisfy WP:NOR and WP:V.  Where the subject is not true science, or is borderline, a further test should be simply whether others have written about it.  WP:N provides this test.  A lot of work has been invested in this project page, but that is not sufficient reason to adopt it.  It is rule creep, and it does damage by obfuscating more important policies and guidelines.

There seems to be tendency here for some to want a guideline to provide a science-quality test.  This is not an encyclopaedia’s role.  The ascribing of “Finge science”, “pseudo science” or “lunacy” to any theory is a job for third party sources, not for wikipedia rules.  

EMS suggests that some nasty debates exist because of the weakness of this guideline.  Some elaboration would be nice.  Discussion above suggests to me that the relativity article needs work, not that wikipedia needs more rules.

This project page should be abandoned.  Science is well covered by WP:OR and WP:V, and where notability is needed, the general WP:N seems to be sufficient and its use is accepted. --[[User:SmokeyJoe|SmokeyJoe]] 02:08, 22 August 2007 (UTC)

It’s always about sourcing, specifically whether the sources are sufficiently independent, sufficiently secondary, sufficiently reputable (not a blog or similar), or covers the subject in sufficient depth.  These are all straight WP:N issues, deriving directly from a combination of WP:NOR and WP:V.  There is plenty of evidence of spirited debate in places about the science of the content involved, and this sometimes is uncivil, but such spirited debate seems to me to be irrelevant to the debates, and always a symptom of editors who are too far into OR editing and are not looking at the subject objectively.  This is why Notability (science) may do more harm than good.  It suggests that there is something special about science.  The criteria for inclusion in wikipedia do not depend upon the science.

==physics? i think not==
do not confuse the observer effect with the uncertainty principle. the uncertainty principle has nothing to do with &quot;observing&quot;, it has to do with measuring. the observer effect is a supposed effect of observing an event and the influence of your presence on the event. no one would ever have to actually observe a particle's position to obfuscate its momentum, the mere act of using the photons to measure its position, even if nobody ever observed it, would suffice.

-------------
don't you have to observe in order to measure?
-------------

Indeed.  But what does measuring have to do with Quantum Mechanics exactly?  

To measure is to observe the results of a measurement process [that ascertains the subject measurement].  Humans observe with their senses — the senses that humans have.  Other conscious beings, perhaps including computers, may have other senses with which they can implement tools for making measurements.  At the end of the day, measuring ''ALWAYS'' involves observing.  

Tools used by beings to make measurements are limited (in their accuracy) by various factors including the limitations of ones senses.  The often-mentioned example of bouncing a photon off of an atom to measure its position illustrates the problem with knowing the position ''AND'' momentum of ''THAT'' atom at the ''SAME MOMENT'' in time.  The concept usually centers on the fact that the position measurement photon will change the momentum of the subject atom.  But aren't there other aspects of this problem?  

In the limit (considering the non-zero mass of the atom and the non-zero energy of the photon), can one ever know perfectly even the position alone?  Perhaps so, since the mechanical inertance of the atom precludes its reaction at ''THAT'' infinitesimal instant in time.  

Why is not ''THIS'' example an instance of &quot;observer effect&quot; rather than the uncertainty principle, per se?  If one seeks only to measure the position alone, then maybe it is neither.  Then again, is it not &quot;Observer Effect&quot; even if the momentum is changed by measuring only the position?  One would think so.  

Well, what if we start with measuring the momentum &quot;first&quot;?  How does one measure momentum, anyway?  Again, we observers devise a measurement process that allows our senses to detect the &quot;answer.&quot;  Momentum is mass times velocity.  If we know the mass, we might then seek to measure the velocity.  Human observers tend to ascertain velocity by measuring position at two points in time.  For non-zero velocities, this means two different points in space, of course.  Yet, [instantaneous] velocity is ''DEFINED'' at only one point in space and time.  Thus, one cannot measure velocity (or momentum) in this manner: one must ''WAIT'' to ''SEE'' how fast it is moving, and this yields only an average (not instantaneous) value.  

Before continuing on to propose measuring momentum, per se, by some other means (say, smashing the atom into an obstacle at a known position), we should note that the Uncertainty Principle pertains only to Quantum Mechanics.  In ''THAT'' world, particles are not particles; rather, they are probability density functions.  The interpretation of this ''MODEL'' of a particle says the position and momentum of the subject particle are INHERENTLY uncertain by virtue of the mathematical model itself.  To precisely derive the position, one must manipulate the model in a manner that causes the momentum &quot;to drop out of the formula,&quot; and vice versa.  

The relationship between position and momentum described by Quantum Mechanics is somewhat like the relationship between the time domain and the frequency domain described by the Fourier Transform.  One can say that there is some similarity as well between position and velocity in Classical Mechanics.  In fact, the description above with knowing the velocity versus position of the atom is exactly that: Classical Mechanics. 

Following this line of thinking, one (''such as this user who is not fluent in the intricate semantics of Quantum Theory'') might be likely to reach these conclusions: 
 

'''1. Using &quot;particulate&quot; atoms and photons to describe the Uncertainty Principle of Quantum Mechanics is ''flat wrong''.''' 

'''2. One does not observe Quantum Mechanics.  Rather, one uses that theory to make calculations to explain the observations of certain experiments.'''

'''3. Measurements ''ALWAYS'' involve observations and therefore also ''ALWAYS'' involve the Observer Effect.  Perhaps this ''IS'' the “Theory of the Observer Effect.”'''

'''4. The Uncertainty Principle of Quantum Mechanics and the Observer Effect are ''fundamentally'' unrelated.'''  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:JimRodgers|JimRodgers]] ([[User talk:JimRodgers|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/JimRodgers|contribs]]) 12:54, 31 July 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

For some reason this article is more focused on what the observer effect is not. --[[User:Nathanael Bar-Aur L.|Nathanael Bar-Aur L.]] 20:09, 10 April 2007 (UTC)

From what I understood from other sources, the observer effect is basically the collapsing of a quantum system's wavefunction that happens the moment a measurement in made upon it (by an &quot;observer&quot;), therefore cancelling any superposition that may have existed beforehand, and giving specific definition to the renderings. Is this correct? --[[User:Nathanael Bar-Aur L.|Nathanael Bar-Aur L.]] 20:21, 10 April 2007 (UTC)

==Suggestions==
Current article states &quot;not that of the driveshaft, along the axis of the car&quot;.
Add a paragraph that illustrates this with the driveshaft of the front-engine, rear-wheel-drive Porsche 928.
Also industrial examples and diagrams from mechanical engineering and classical mechanics.
e.g. a torque tube to allign parts of a hinge operated by two hydraulic cylinders.&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/206.188.57.60|206.188.57.60]] ([[User talk:206.188.57.60|talk]]) 14:42, 30 October 2006 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;

== Diagrams ==
Can anyone find a picture of this? I'm having a very hard time picturing what this would look like...[[User:70.157.134.125|70.157.134.125]] 01:01, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

==Accuracy==
This page is not really accurate. Cars like the STS, Corvette, etc. have independent rear suspensions, and the torque tube is not used to transmit acceleration forces in these vehicles. Rather, it is because they have trans-axles in the rear of the car and it connects the trans-axle with the engine in the front. However, I am not enough of an expert on the subject to write a clear and well-written clarification so I have just added some templates to the top of the page. --[[User:Ozziegt|Ozziegt]] ([[User talk:Ozziegt|talk]]) 21:33, 1 July 2009 (UTC)

:Corvette since at least 1988 doesn't have a torque tube (unless they put one in later), and apart from the Miata I'm hard pushed to think of an IRS that uses one. I agree, this article is pretty horrid, it needs a rewrite rather than refs. [[User:Greglocock|Greglocock]] ([[User talk:Greglocock|talk]]) 11:13, 2 July 2009 (UTC)

:Corvettes since the late 90's do indeed have torque tubes, of the same type that the Porsche 924/944/928 etc use.  All the mentioned Porsches are IRS and use a torque tube.  Part of the probem with this article is that it lumps very diverse systems together;  the early Ford systems are completely different from the Corvette/Porsche systems.  Both are classified as torque tubes, but the article does not focus on the essence of a TT, which is the use of a smaller torque-transmitting element inside a carrier. The carrier may or may not be static and may or may not be carrying driveline forces (like the Fords). [[User:52FordF-1|52FordF-1]] ([[User talk:52FordF-1|talk]]) 15:44, 18 July 2009 (UTC)

::Yup my bad, 2005 Corvette (as a random example) uses a transaxle and a torque tube. Note that the Corvette system is different to the Peugoet one, as the latter includes an articulating joint at the front whereas the Corvette system does not. This is a big deal, to a driveline engineer at least.[[User:Greglocock|Greglocock]] ([[User talk:Greglocock|talk]]) 23:25, 18 July 2009 (UTC)

:Agreed. The article as written is essentially BS. A torque tube fundamentally counteracts the torque of the driveshaft; the alternative is that the torque is counteracted by the torsional rigidity of the frame (the net torque must, obviously, be zero otherwise the rear of the car would rotate). The torque tube often does transfer forward wheel force to the front of the car, but this is not inherent in the mere fact of having a torque tube: there must still be a mechanism locating the wheels longitudinally relative to the diff/transaxle. This is analogous to the usual need to locate the wheels relative to the frame (most simply, with leaf springs) in order to move the car forward.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/110.175.57.184|110.175.57.184]] ([[User talk:110.175.57.184|talk]]) 05:05, 18 March 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== simple definition? ==

It has been my understanding from looking through service manuals and talking to mechanics that the corvette style torque tubes are just an enclosed driveshaft that connects a front mounted engine to the rear mounted transmission (with fully independent rear suspension)

I guess it's not simply called a 'driveshaft' in a classical sense since it doesn't connect a front mounted transmission to the rear differential  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/184.57.87.173|184.57.87.173]] ([[User talk:184.57.87.173|talk]]) 20:38, 15 August 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</text>

'''''Hello!'''''

Thanks for uploading some pictures to Wikipedia.  I wanted to make sure you were aware of some of the requirements and good practices for uploaded images.

*'''Pick an image name.'''
:When [[Special:Upload|uploading]] an image, pick a file name that is descriptive, and unique.  Remember that many images may be uploaded about the same topic, and remember that names are case sensitive.

*'''Source the image.'''
:On the [[Help:Image page|image description page]], explain where the image came from.  If you created the image yourself, then say so.  If it's from the web, give a URL.  If it's a screenshot of a movie or game, or a scan from a book, give the title.

*'''Provide copyright and license information.'''
:This part is a little bit trickier, but it's very important.  The copyright of the image generally belongs to whomever created it.
::''If it's a photograph you took, or an image you created'' (modifying an image that already exists doesn't count) in software like [[Photoshop]] or [[GIMP]], then you own the copyright.  To upload it to Wikipedia, you must agree to license it under the [[GFDL]] (which allows anyone to use it, but requires that they give credit to the original author and requires that any further edit to the image be licensed under the GFDL as well) or release it into the [[public domain]] (which allows anyone to use it for any purpose without restriction.)  Do this by placing an appropriate [[WP:ICT|tag]] on the [[Wikipedia:image description page|image description page]], like &amp;#123;{[[Template:GFDL|GFDL]]}} or &amp;#123;{[[Template:PD|PD]]}}.  Be sure to mention that you created the image.  If you're using &amp;#123;{[[Template:PD|PD]]}}, you may also want to use &amp;#123;{[[Template:NoRightsReserved|NoRightsReserved]]}}, since there is some dispute as to whether one may grant items into the public domain.
::''If you didn't create the image,'' or the copyright somehow belongs to another party (like a screenshot, which you might &quot;create&quot;, but the copyright belongs to the author of the movie or video game), then you need to find another [[WP:ICT|tag]] that describes the copyright status of the image.  Images used on Wikipedia need to be free for our use and the use of [[WP:FORKS|sites]] which reproduce our content.  This means that images cannot have a restriction such as &quot;only for use by Wikipedia&quot;, or &quot;for non-commercial use only&quot;, or &quot;for educational use&quot;.  Images without a free license may be usable in certain articles under [[WP:FU|fair use]], but such a use should be justified on the image description page.

*'''Describe the image.'''
:To another reader, the image may not be immediately understood.  A caption in an article doesn't explain the image to a visitor who sees it on its image page.  Put a brief explanation of what is in the image on the image description page, similar to what you might include in a caption on an article.  

Some links to Wikipedia pages on this subject: 

'''[[Wikipedia:Copyrights#Image guidelines|Copyrights]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags|Copyright tags]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Fair use|Fair use]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Image description page|Image description page]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Granting work into the public domain|Public domain]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion|Images for deletion]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Possibly unfree images|Possibly unfree images]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Copyright problems|Copyright problems]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Uploading images|Uploading images]]'''

Thanks again for your contributions.  If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me at my talk page. [[User:Feydey|feydey]] 19:42, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

An '''anti-submarine missile'''  is a [[standoff missile|standoff]] [[anti-submarine weapon]]. Often a variant of [[anti-ship missile]] designs an anti-submarine systems typically use a [[jet engine|jet]] or [[rocket engine|rocket]] engine, to deliver: an [[explosive material|explosive]] [[warhead]] aimed directly at a [[submarine]]; a [[depth charge]], or;  a homing [[torpedo]] that is carried from a launch ship, or other  platform, to the vicinity of a target.
[[File:Ikara missile.JPG|thumb|right|&lt;small&gt;[[Ikara (missile)|Ikara]], an [[Australia]]n-designed missile used by several navies between the 1960s and 1990s; a [[rocket engine|rocket]]-parachute delivery system carried an [[acoustic torpedo]] up to 10 nautical miles (19 km) after launch. A variant re-designed in the UK and used by the Royal Navy could deliver a [[Nuclear depth bomb|nuclear depth charge]].&lt;/small&gt;]]
[[File:Maille-Braize-14.jpg|thumb|&lt;small&gt;The [[Malafon]], used by the French Navy between 1966 and 1997, used a rocket-assisted glider to carry a torpedo up to 8 nautical miles (13 km) after launch&lt;/small&gt;. ]]

==History==
[[Depth charge]]s were the earliest weapons designed for use by ships against submerged [[submarine]]s. These explosives were initially dropped as the ship moved over the presumed location of a submarine. Before World War II, shipboard [[sonar]] was unable to maintain contact with a submarine at close range. 

Various [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]]-type projectors, including [[hedgehog (weapon)|hedgehog]] and [[squid (weapon)|squid]], were devised during [[World War II]] to allow a ship to maintain sonar contact while lobbing explosive charges toward the submarine.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Terry, and Costello, John ''The Battle of the Atlantic'' (1977) Dial Press {{Listed Invalid ISBN|0-8037-6454-2}} pp.307-308&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the [[Cold War]], [[missile]]s were developed to provide greater range with reduced [[recoil]]. Some missiles and rockets carry [[homing torpedo]]es to provide terminal guidance for the warhead.&lt;ref&gt;Albrecht, Gerhard ''Weyer's Warships of the World'' (1969) United States Naval Institute p.385&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''northern river shark''' or '''New Guinea river shark''' (''Glyphis garricki'') is a [[species]] of [[requiem shark]], in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Requiem shark|Carcharhinidae]] found in scattered [[tidal river]]s and associated coastal waters in northern [[Australia]] and in [[Papua New Guinea]]. This species inhabits areas with poor visibility, soft bottoms, and large [[tide]]s, with immature sharks ranging into [[freshwater|fresh]] and [[brackish water]]. It is similar to other river sharks in having a stocky grey body with a high back, tiny eyes, and broad fins. It measures up to {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} long.

Northern river sharks are likely [[piscivorous]]. This species is [[viviparous]], with females bearing litters of 9 young possibly every other year before the [[wet season]]. Very rare and facing threats from [[commercial fishing|commercial]] and [[recreational fishing]], and perhaps also [[habitat degradation]], this species has been assessed as [[Critically Endangered]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]].

==Taxonomy==
The first known specimens of the northern river shark, two newborn males from Papua New Guinea, were discovered by [[New Zealand]] [[ichthyologist]] [[Jack Garrick]], after whom the species was eventually  named. This shark was referred to as &quot;''Glyphis'' sp. C&quot; until 2008, when it was formally described by [[Leonard Compagno]], William White, and [[Peter R. Last]] in a [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] paper. The [[type specimen]] is a female {{convert|67|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, collected from the [[East Alligator River]], [[Kakadu National Park]], [[Northern Territory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Compagno, L.J.V. |author2=W.T.

==Distribution and habitat==
The northern river shark has been reported from [[King Sound]], the [[Ord River]], and Doctors Creek near [[Derby, Western Australia]], the [[Adelaide River|Adelaide]] and [[Alligator Rivers]] in Australia's [[Northern Territory]], and the [[Daru]] region and possibly the [[Fly River]] in Papua New Guinea. It inhabits large [[river]]s, [[estuaries]], and coastal [[bay]]s, all of which are characterized by high [[turbidity]], silty or muddy bottoms, and large tides. Young and juvenile sharks are found in fresh, brackish, and salt water ([[salinity]] ranging from 2 to 36 ppt), whereas adults have only been found in marine environments.&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pillans et al&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pillans, R.D. |author2=J.D.

==Description==
Like other members of its genus, the northern river shark has a stocky body with a high back. The head is wide and flattened, with a broadly rounded snout and minute eyes equipped with [[nictitating membrane]]s. Each [[nostril]] is divided into a very large incurrent opening and a small excurrent opening by a triangular skin flap. The sizable mouth is broadly arched, with short furrows at the corners. Thirty-one to 34 tooth rows are in the upper jaw and 30&amp;ndash;35 tooth rows are in the lower jaw; the upper teeth are upright and triangular with serrated edges, while the lower teeth are narrower and straight to slightly curved. In the largest individuals, the first few lower teeth from the jaw median are spear-shaped with serrations near the tip.&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;/&gt;

The [[pectoral fin]]s are large and broad, with gently backward-curving margins and pointed tips. The [[pelvic fin]]s are triangular with nearly straight trailing margins. The first [[dorsal fin]] is long-based and triangular, with the apex almost forming a right angle; the second dorsal fin is some two-thirds as high as the first. The origin of the first dorsal fin lies over the pectoral fin insertions, while that of second dorsal fin lies over the pelvic fin rear tips. No ridge exists between the dorsal fins. The [[anal fin]] is smaller than the second dorsal fin and has a strong notch in the rear margin. The [[caudal fin]] has a strong lower lobe and a long, narrow upper lobe with a ventral notch near the tip. The [[dermal denticle]]s are small, oval, and overlapping, bearing three horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth. This shark is steel-gray above and white below; the color transition is sharp, located well below the eye, and becomes jagged on the sides of the trunk. The anal and caudal fins become dusky or black towards the trailing margins and tips. The maximum known length is {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}}. This species differs from the [[speartooth shark]] (''G. glyphis'') in several [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] and [[meristic]] characters, including having fewer [[vertebra]]e (137&amp;ndash;151 versus 213&amp;ndash;222) and a lower, jagged gray-white color boundary.&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;/&gt;

==Biology and ecology==
With its slender teeth, small eyes, and high density of [[ampullae of Lorenzini]], the northern river shark seems to be [[adaptation|adapted]] for hunting [[fish]] in conditions of poor visibility. In Doctors Creek, sharks may move to and from favored feeding areas with the tide.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thorburn, D.C., D.L. Morgan, A.J. Rowland and H.S. Gill. (February 2004). [http://www.environment.gov.au/coasts/publications/pubs/glyphis-wa.pdf The northern river shark (''Glyphis'' sp. C) in Western Australia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108234623/http://environment.gov.au/coasts/publications/pubs/glyphis-wa.pdf |date=8 November 2011 }}. Report to the National Heritage Trust, Murdoch University. Retrieved on 10 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Like other requiem sharks, this species is [[viviparous]], with the developing [[embryo]]s forming a [[placenta]]l connection to their mother after exhausting their supply of [[yolk]]. Females give birth around October, before the start of the [[wet season]], on possibly a biennial cycle. One female examined contained nine [[fetus]]es.&lt;ref name=&quot;pillans et al&quot;/&gt; The young are born at under {{convert|67|cm|in|abbr=on}} long; males [[sexual maturity|mature]] between lengths of {{convert|1.2|and|1.4|m|ft|abbr=on}}, while females mature between lengths of {{convert|1.4|and|1.7|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;/&gt;

==Human interactions==
The northern river shark appears to be extremely rare, though more subpopulations may remain to be discovered in Australia and Papua New Guinea. Based on present information, no more than 250 mature individuals are estimated to exist in the wild, with no more than 50 in any particular subpopulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt; This species is caught legally and illegally by [[commercial fisheries]] using [[longline fishing|longlines]] and [[gillnet]]s, as well as by [[recreational fishing|recreational fishers]]; [[habitat degradation]] may pose a further threat to its survival. Because of its low natural abundance, limited distribution, stringent habitat requirements, and susceptibility to various human-caused threats, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] has assessed the northern river shark as [[critically endangered]]. It has also been listed as endangered on the 1999 Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, and on the 2000 Territory Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act. Kakadu National Park may be an important protected area for this species.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt; No regulations restrict the capture of this species in Papua New Guinea.&lt;ref name=&quot;white et al&quot;/&gt;

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Zoidberg. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Zoidberg~enwiki that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]]. If you think you might own all of the accounts with this name and this message is in error, please visit [[Special:MergeAccount]] to check and attach all of your accounts to prevent them from being renamed.

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== Hare Krishna picture ==

There is a picture of a Hare Krishna procession in the [[Religion_in_Mexico#Buddhism|Buddhism]] section, even with a caption about them being buddhists. Hare Krishnas are not buddhists, they are hindus. The article is semi-protected so I can not correct that myself. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Wenzelkarbovski|Wenzelkarbovski]] ([[User talk:Wenzelkarbovski|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Wenzelkarbovski|contribs]]) 17:39, 22 April 2015 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Self-ascription fallacy ==

''The last census reported, by self-ascription, that over 95% of the population is Christian.''

The so-called self-ascription of the census is nothing but a silly way of measuring data. Obviously they count children as Christians just because their parents say so. This people should either be clear about this or not count children at all. By the way, since a couple of years ago the Catholic Church has started to indoctrinate [[Huichol]] kids. Shame on us, Mexicans. Shame on us... The Huichols were one of the very few indigenous people whose religious tradition haven't been polluted by Catholicism but now the church has started taking advantage of the poverty of this people and the new constitutional reforms to infiltrate to their villages and improvise &quot;schools&quot;. Of course they know that adults wouldn't let themselves be indoctrinated so they choose to attack young minds. Catholicism and ignorance have been the ingredients of our condition as a Third World country.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Scandza|Scandza]] ([[User talk:Scandza|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Scandza|contribs]]) 13:27, 30 May 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;


Can anyone explain why the Evangelical Free Church of America does so many, many missionary trips to Mexico, when it's a predominantly catholic country? I mean, there are definite ideological differences involved, but I wasn't aware the two churches actively tried to convert each other's members.


==First phrase==

Any interest in removing &quot;Unlike some other Latin American countries&quot; from the first sentence of the article? It does not seem to serve any objective purpose and seems slightly antagonistic.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Namenderkrieg|Namenderkrieg]] ([[User talk:Namenderkrieg|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Namenderkrieg|contribs]]) 15:34, 24 March 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Easter==

I'm removing this:

&quot;Some of them however, do not celebrate Easter because they think that the Easter Bunny is the devil. Instead of celebrating Easter, they like to eat Mexican Pizzas.&quot;

because it's obviously untrue and just stupid. I think the article should be rewritten though, by someone more experienced than I am.--[[User:PARCGOP|PARCGOP]] 14:09, 7 April 2007 (UTC)

==Contradiction?==
This article says that 95% of people in Mexico are Roman Catholic.  The Mexico article states that 95% of people are Christian, and only 89% are Roman Catholic.  Which is correct, or am I just confused?
[[User:Yumecosmos|Yumecosmos]] ([[User talk:Yumecosmos|talk]]) 02:20, 9 January 2008 (UTC)

== Rewriting ==

I have imported the Religion section from the article on [[Mexico]] and integrated the information that was only on this article. I also moved around paragraphs and added a subtitle to make reading easier. Finally I removed the stub templates and replaced it with the expand one. --[[User:Marianika|Marianika]] ([[User talk:Marianika|talk]]) 16:32, 19 May 2008 (UTC)

== What about non-believers? ==

What about atheists, agnostics, deists in Mexico? How many Mexicans actually believe in God? Is there any data about that?  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/213.196.243.113|213.196.243.113]] ([[User talk:213.196.243.113|talk]]) 22:41, 27 May 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Mexican Ethnic Religion (Mexicayotl) ==

This article lacks a part about the growing movement of Mexicayotl, or Ethnic Mexican Culture or Religion, which is the revival of &quot;Aztec&quot; religion. --[[Special:Contributions/79.45.49.143|79.45.49.143]] ([[User talk:79.45.49.143|talk]]) 12:47, 16 August 2010 (UTC)

== Typo in Nonreligious section ==

'''John Ralph Ragazzini''' (January 3, 1912&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pnxBAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=John+Ralph+Ragazzini+1912&amp;dq=John+Ralph+Ragazzini+1912&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjC4sew9dPVAhXMHJoKHeWmAFsQ6AEIKzAB Profile of John Ralph Ragazzini]&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; November 22, 1988) was an [[United States|American]] [[electrical engineer]] and a professor of [[Electrical Engineering]]. 

==Biography==
Ragazzini was born in [[Manhattan, New York City]] and received the degrees of B.S. and E.E. at the [[City College of New York]] in 1932 and 1933 and earned the degrees of A.M. and Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at [[Columbia University]] in 1939 and 1941.

Ragazzini was dean of the School of Engineering and Science at [[New York University]] and during [[World War II]] he was chairman of the Department of Electrical Engineering at Columbia University, where he was involved in the [[Manhattan Project]].

Ragazzini's notable students are [[Rudolf E. Kálmán]] (see [[Kalman filter]]s), [[Eliahu Ibraham Jury]] (see [[Z-transform]]), [[Gene F. Franklin]] (see [[digital control]]), and [[Lotfi Asker Zadeh]] (see [[Fuzzy sets]] and [[Fuzzy logic]]).

Ragazzini is also credited, along with Lotfi Zadeh, in 1952, to have pioneered the development of the [[z-transform]] method in [[discrete-time]] [[signal processing]] and analysis.

In 1970 he received the [[Rufus Oldenburger Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asme.org/about-asme/honors-awards/achievement-awards/rufus-oldenburger-medal |title=Rufus Oldenburger Medal |publisher=[[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] |accessdate={{Format date|2013|2|14}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, [[American Automatic Control Council]] named [[John R. Ragazzini Award]] after Ragazzini and he was the first recipient of the award. Ragazzini died on 22 November 1988, aged 76.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/24/obituaries/john-ragazzini-76-educator-and-engineer.html&lt;/ref&gt;

I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under [[Wikipedia:Fair use|fair use]] but there is no [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline|explanation or rationale]] as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags/Fair use|boilerplate fair use template]], you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with [[WP:FU|fair use]].

Please go to [[:Image:Brokeninpieces.jpg|the image description page]] and edit it to include a [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline |fair use rationale]]. Using one of the templates at [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline]] is an easy way to insure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template. Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.

If there is other other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on the other images used on this page.

The '''United Church, Chapel on the Hill''' in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]] was the city's main church during [[World War II]]. Dedicated on September 30, 1943 and completed late in October 1943, it was originally a multi-denominational [[chapel]] shared by [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and [[Judaism|Jewish]] congregations.&lt;ref name=NationalRegister/&gt;&lt;ref name=churchhistory&gt;[http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=category&amp;sectionid=4&amp;id=39&amp;Itemid=55 Church History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728092956/http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=category&amp;sectionid=4&amp;id=39&amp;Itemid=55 |date=July 28, 2011 }}, United Church, Chapel on the Hill website, accessed March 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architectural design ==
The building design is a [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] 700-series [[U.S. Army]] chapel.&lt;ref name=Townsite&gt;[http://oakridgevisitor.com/history/pdf/OriginalTownSites.pdf Chapel on the Hill] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517124718/http://oakridgevisitor.com/history/pdf/OriginalTownSites.pdf |date=May 17, 2008 }} in ''Jackson Square – the original Townsite'', Oak Ridge Convention and Visitors' Bureau&lt;/ref&gt; It is a frame building built on a three-bay rectangular plan with a [[Steeple (architecture)|steeple]]d [[bell tower]] and a [[gable]] entry [[porch]]. It was one of three Army chapels built using the same design in Oak Ridge during World War II. One of the other two chapels, the West Chapel in the city's West Village area, was later torn down, but the East Chapel in the East Village is still in use.&lt;ref name=NationalRegister&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfo.doe.gov/me70/history/NPSweb/Oak_Ridge_Historic_District_(Preferred).pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form for Oak Ridge Historic District |date=July 18, 1991 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829041710/http://www.cfo.doe.gov/me70/history/NPSweb/Oak_Ridge_Historic_District_%28Preferred%29.pdf |archivedate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The U.S. Army built the chapel to house religious activities, as one of numerous community facilities in the &quot;townsite&quot; area of Oak Ridge. The building was dedicated on September 30, 1943, in a ceremony that included [[prayer]]s and talks by a Jewish [[rabbi]], a [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|Catholic priest]], an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] priest, a [[Baptist]] minister, and the [[minister (Christianity)|minister]] who was serving the United Church congregation that eventually came to own the chapel.&lt;ref&gt;Charles W. Johnson and Charles O. Jackson (1981), ''City Behind a Fence: Oak Ridge, Tennessee, 1942-1946''. The University of Tennessee Press. Pages 127-129.&lt;/ref&gt; Its name, &quot;The Chapel on the Hill,&quot; comes from a reference in a prayer by the Knoxville Baptist minister who participated in the dedication.&lt;ref name=Townsite/&gt;

The United Church congregation that is housed in the Chapel on the Hill traces its history to July 18, 1943, when some 25 to 30 Christians of diverse denominational backgrounds gathered for Sunday worship in Oak Ridge's main [[cafeteria]]. Subsequently, several members of the group made plans to establish an interdenominational Protestant church, led by [[laity|layperson]]s, to include all denominations. A [[Presbyterian]] minister working in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] was engaged to conduct weekly services, and about 150 people representing 13 Protestant denominations became charter members of &quot;the United Church&quot;. Governing boards of laypersons elected to lead the new congregation took up their duties on October 24, 1943.&lt;ref name=pre1980&gt;[http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=51&amp;Itemid=55 Pre-1980 Historical Compilation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728093006/http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=51&amp;Itemid=55 |date=July 28, 2011 }}, United Church, Chapel on the Hill website, accessed March 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Chapel-on-the-Hill was completed that same month, the United Church and the local Roman Catholic Church were given control of the building, as the only two churches then officially operating in the [[Manhattan Project]] community. During the war, when Oak Ridge's Manhattan Project facilities were operating around the clock, the chapel building was also in use nearly 24 hours a day as a venue for worship services, [[wedding]]s, and other occasions for local workers of various Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish religious backgrounds.&lt;ref name=pre1980/&gt;

At the peak of wartime activity in Oak Ridge, when the population exceeded 70,000, the United Church employed four ministers and conducted worship services in the Chapel on the Hill, East Village Chapel, and the Jefferson Theater, as well as [[Sunday school]] classes in several local schools and a [[mobile home|trailer]] camp. By 1951, the United Church Chapel-on-the-Hill consolidated as a single [[interdenominational]] congregation, making its home in the Chapel on the Hill building.&lt;ref name=pre1980/&gt;

The United Church congregation purchased the chapel and {{convert|3.72|acre|ha}} of land from the [[U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]] on May 11, 1955 for a price of $17,116.&lt;ref name=pre1980/&gt; An adjoining educational building was added in 1956-1957.

It is felt that the article you created at [[Ethan cavett]] is not suitable for a Wikipedia article, which must have a [[Wikipedia:Notability|notable]] subject and be [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verifiable]]. I have moved it to [[User:{{PAGENAME}}]], which is where users are free to write about themselves. You are at liberty to move it back into the (Main) namespace but bear in mind that if you do so, it is likely to be nominated for deletion. 

Note, however, that the purpose of a user page is to enable active editors of Wikipedia to introduce themselves to other editors. [[WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_a_blog.2C_webspace_provider.2C_or_social_networking_site|Wikipedia is not a general hosting service]], so your user page is not a personal homepage. Content unrelated to Wikipedia or its editing is likely to be removed.

Please see [[WP:User_page|the user page guidelines]], especially [[WP:User_page#What_can_I_not_have_on_my_user_page.3F|this section]] for more information. -- [[User:Omicronpersei8|Omicronpersei8]] ([[User talk:Omicronpersei8|talk]]) 19:36, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

'''Archer''' is a [[slab serif]] typeface designed in 2001 by [[Tobias Frere-Jones]] and [[Jonathan Hoefler]] for use in ''[[Martha Stewart Living]]'' magazine. It was later released by [[Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones]] for commercial licensing.

==Structure==

The typeface is a [[Slab_serif#Geometric_model|geometric]] slab serif, one with a geometric design similar to sans-serif fonts. It takes inspiration from mid-twentieth century designs such as [[Rockwell (typeface)|Rockwell]].

The face is unique for combining the geometric structure of twentieth-century European slab-serifs but imbuing the face with a domestic, less strident tone of voice. [[Ball terminal|Balls]] were added to the upper terminals on letters such as ''C'' and ''G'' to increase its charm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Devroye|first1=Luc|title=Jonathan Hoefler|url=http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-27370.html|publisher=McGill University|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Italic type|Italics]] are true italic designs, with flourishes influenced by calligraphy, an unusual feature for geometric slab serif designs. As with many [[Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones]] designs, it was released in a wide range of weights from hairline to bold, reflecting its design goal as a typeface for complex magazines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Typographica review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Earls|first1=David John|title=Archer|url=http://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/archer/|website=Typographica|accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
The typeface has been used for, among other things, branding for [[Wells Fargo]] and is a main font for the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' and [[Wes Anderson]]'s film ''[[The Grand Budapest Hotel]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=Lauren|title=Is Archer's Use on Target?|url=http://www.aiga.org/is-archers-use-on-target/|publisher=AIGI}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the current font used for titles and body text by the [[Design Observer]] website.

===[[Katisha]]===
Contains no information not in [[The Mikado]] article, the point of the spin-off unclear, as the character only appears in one opera, and it's unclear how this could expand further. In normal circumstances I'd say merge or make it a redirect, but, as I said, everything IS covered in [[The Mikado]], and I can't imagine someone searching for &quot;Katisha&quot;.

*'''Delete''' article per nomination.  Anything notable about this character should appear in the plot summary of ''[[The Mikado]]''.  There is no reason to have a separate article for this character.  -- [[User:Ssilvers|Ssilvers]] 19:59, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Redirect''' it to [[The Mikado]] -- merge isn't needed since the info's there, but the redirect could be useful -- somebody could search for it. -- [[User:ArglebargleIV|ArglebargleIV]] 22:15, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

A tag has been placed on [[:Nonamaker]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article seems to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable [[Wikipedia:Notability|(see the guidelines for notability here)]]. If you can indicate why the subject of this article is notable, you may contest the tagging. To do this, please affix the template &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; to the page and leave a note on [[Talk:Nonamaker|the article's talk page]] explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself.

Please read the [[WP:CSD|criteria for speedy deletion]] (specifically, article #7) and [[Wikipedia:Notability (people)|our general biography criteria]].

== Waterboarding ==

Could you post a link where somebody calls [[surfing]] [[waterboarding]]?  I can't seem to find any. [[User:Jehochman|Jehochman]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Jehochman|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:46, 26 April 2009 (UTC)

Yes, Waterboarding is a very common term in Hawaii, the Western US, Australia and even some former Soviet countries. Here's a link to an article where the author references this http://mydailyclarity.com/2009/03/surfing-for-peace-in-the-gaza/. Also, I found a site that references waterboarding here http://www.hawaiiansouthshore.com/shop/product.php?productid=17375. It get's confusing; I was looking for 'surfing' but we call it Waterboarding so I got to the wrong page ;-)

: Fair enough.  That source uses &quot;water boarding&quot; with a space.  I've made a change to your edit to reflect the space. [[User:Jehochman|Jehochman]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Jehochman|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:23, 26 April 2009 (UTC)</text>

I removed &quot;2006 is only his second full season as a team-manager. It took other team managers, such as [[Frank Williams]] many years to win a grand prix as manager.&quot;

This suggests Fry is responsible for a dramatic turnaround in the team's performance - their 2005 and 2006 performances have been widely acknowledged to have been poor to middling. the circumstances of the Hungarian GP were also exceptional. [[User:Mark83|Mark83]] 19:37, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

::It has been reported in the Telegraph (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/motorsport/formulaone/5369856/Monaco-Grand-Prix-Jenson-Buttons-playboy-days-behind-him.html) that Nick Fry owns a proportion of the team, and in an earlier article, that he owns the majority stake. Shouldn't this be added?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/92.239.225.23|92.239.225.23]] ([[User talk:92.239.225.23|talk]]) 23:17, 28 May 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Klein-Glienicke Schweizerhaus 1.jpg|thumb|320px|''Schweizerhaus'' in [[Klein Glienicke]] near [[Berlin]], designed by [[Ferdinand von Arnim]], 1867]]
'''Swiss chalet style''' ({{lang-de|Schweizerstil}}, {{lang-no|Sveitserstil}}) is an [[architectural style]] of [[Historicism (art)|Late Historicism]], originally inspired by rural [[chalet]]s in [[Switzerland]] and the [[Alps|Alpine]] (mountainous) regions of [[Central Europe]]. The style refers to traditional building designs characterised by widely projecting roofs and facades richly decorated with wooden balconies and carved ornaments. It spread over [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Austria-Hungary]] and [[Scandinavia]] during the ''[[Belle Époque]]'' era.

==History==
[[File:Villa Fridheim, Krøderen, 2.jpg|thumb|Villa Fridheim in [[Krødsherad]], Norway]]
Swiss chalet style originated in the [[German Romanticism|Romantic]] era of the late-18th/early-19th century, when the ideas of the [[English landscape garden]] inspired parks and residences in Germany, such as the [[Dessau-Wörlitz Garden Realm]]. It became highly appreciated on the continent by noble landowners who were impressed by the &quot;simple life&quot; of people living in the mountains. 

The chalet style soon spread over the German ''[[Mittelgebirge]]'' landscapes such as the [[Harz]] mountains or the [[Dresden]] area and the adjacent [[North Bohemia]]n region. As a &quot;modern&quot; building style, it also influenced the [[resort architecture]] along the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] seaside, like in [[Binz]] or [[Heringsdorf, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|Heringsdorf]]. Around 1900, design elements were used in the construction of numerous bourgeois family homes as well as by notable architects like [[Heinrich von Ferstel]] to build larger mansions and hotels. 

The style was further popularized by the first waves of tourism of rich people from the North and West of Europe and became popular in other parts of Europe and North America, notably in the [[architecture of Norway]], [[architecture of Iceland|Iceland]] and [[Architecture of the Netherlands|the Netherlands]] and in the [[country house]] architecture of [[architecture of Sweden|Sweden]] and [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati (Ohio, USA)]], in the late 19th and early 20th century. English examples of the chalet style include the [[Boathouse at Belton House]], [[Lincolnshire]], by [[Anthony Salvin]] and the Swiss Cottage at [[Osbourne House]], on the [[Isle of Wight]], constructed for [[Queen Victoria]]'s children.

==Characteristics==
The style is characterized by:
*[[Gabled roof|Gabled roofs]] with wide [[eaves]]
*Exposed construction beams, including large [[Bracket (architecture)|brackets]]
*Decorative carving and mouldings
*[[Balconies]]
*Large windows
*[[Weatherboarding]], usually painted, often in bright colors

The result was '''delete'''. -- [[User:Jitse Niesen|Jitse Niesen]] ([[User talk:Jitse Niesen|talk]]) 12:28, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

:In case anybody requires an explanation how I arrived at this decision, as it is a bit borderline: There seems to be only one reliable source, an article repeated in USA Today and other media. What tipped the balance is firstly the weak reasons in some of the &quot;keep&quot; comments (specifically, those of necronudist, Portillo, and I don't understand Minfo); and secondly, I think we should be extremely cautious in having articles about living children. -- [[User:Jitse Niesen|Jitse Niesen]] ([[User talk:Jitse Niesen|talk]]) 12:45, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

* '''Delete''' - he's ten years old, for crying out loud. If he makes it as a pro then add him in but not until then. [[User:Qwghlm|Qwghlm]] 20:09, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
**'''Comment''' You can't delete or not delete an article purely based on age. --[[User:Pinkkeith|Pinkkeith]] 20:11, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
***'''Comment''' - the point is that he doesn't meet [[WP:BIO]]. There are thousands of kids with potential; they get articles here when that potential is realised by playing for the first team of a significant club. WP is not a crystal ball. [[User:BlueValour|BlueValour]] 20:53, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
****'''Comment''' Well, that wasn't the point that you made, but it does pass [[WP:BIO]] based on [[WP:GOOGLE]]. There is no crystal ball to this article at all, it is all based on present information and known fact. --[[User:Pinkkeith|Pinkkeith]] 21:00, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
*****'''Comment''' What &quot;known fact?&quot;  There is not a single source cited in the entire article.  I am particularly leery of this becoming another AFD where the article is kept because of references cited in the AFD discussion that never make it into the article thus defeating the entire purpose of this discussion and [[WP:V]].  --[[User:ElKevbo|ElKevbo]] 14:26, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
*We can, however, '''delete''' an article if no reliable sources are provided when challenged under [[WP:V|verifiability policy]].  Pinkkeith, can you point us to featured coverage in mainstream media?  Some of those are needed to let us keep the article.  Being signed to a youth team isn't notable enough to get thousands of other kids their own WP articles.  [[User:Barno|Barno]] 20:39, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
** Here is a [http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/technology/maney/2005-02-01-maney_x.htm USA Today article] on him. In there the writer mentions that he was covered in numerous other newspapers. --[[User:Pinkkeith|Pinkkeith]] 20:43, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
*** - fine but he has achieved nothing in the adult world - the press references are the result of a splendid publicity campaign for his video but that doesn't confer notability. [[User:BlueValour|BlueValour]] 20:57, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
**** That's blatent [[ephebiphobia]]. Reread the article, the entire article is talking about the video and how it made him notable. --[[User:Pinkkeith|Pinkkeith]] 21:01, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

[http://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=%22Jean+Carlos+Chera%22&amp;btnG=Search+Archives&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8 Google News Archive] search yields 74 unique hits- more than enough to qualify as &quot;the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person.&quot; How old the subject is and the method in which he was made notable isn't relevant; the subject meets [[WP:BIO]]. --[[User talk:Rory096|Rory096]] 21:14, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
:*'''Comment''' - most of the content, apart from his birthdate, fails [[WP:V]]. The Ghits mean we can keep the article not that we must. They are all the result of a single video being published on the internet and they have all picked up the same story.

[[User:BlueValour|BlueValour]] 16:58, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''-So he's a child prodigy, that doesn't make him notable.  Some of my friends are amazing at basketball, but they don't have any articles.  As above, if he makes it to the pros (or college, if Brazil has a college league, I dunno), then we can always repost.

*'''Delete'''  When he has played for Manchester United, Arsenal, Porto, Eindhoven or Real Madrid he will have earned his article.  Until then it is worth remembering that, at least in the UK, it would be highly improper for professional clubs to express an interest in a 10 year old, let alone to 'openly court' them.

*'''Delete''' I've reviewed some of these news articles. I can read only the English ones, which are basically the same novelty one-shot story, repeated, or something like the USA today story, which is more about how everyone is famous on the Internet than a biographical source for an article.

Many of the users are very bias against the idea of a 7yr old having its own article or the fact that his only a child prodigy, but indeed we have a child prodigy article. Im definately getting a sense of outright bias and a feeling that many of the voters here are americans. [[portillo]]

*'''Comment''' - I think most of the delete (and some of the keep) votes are completely missing the point. Of course this kid isn't a notable footballer. He is however notable as an internet/media phenomenon. Wikipedia has plenty of articles for such people, as an example go look at [[Mahir Çağrı]]. Then at the bottom of his page have a look at the categories he's placed in. When someone comes to Wikipedia and searches for &quot;that kid i saw clips of on TV&quot; or &quot;that kid my mate sent me videos of&quot; and who's name give 35,000 google hits... He should be here! [[User:Alii h|aLii]] 15:20, 6 November 2006 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' per norm. [[User:Minfo|м info]] 23:03, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - I wonder if there is a misunderstanding here? If you are a child prodigy as a piano player you can play the piano. If you are a child prodigy as a mathematician you can do complicated sums in your head. Here, the kid undoubtedly has unusual ball skills but that doesn't make him a footballer. I also don't see him as a 'internet/media phenomenon' with any longevity - with YouTube such phenonima come and go like snow in the sun. [[User:TerriersFan|TerriersFan]] 00:01, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
:He was born as a YouTube phenomen but now he's known by all of the users above, has google entries and BBC articles. Guys, you wanna delete him, let's do it. Simply there are people who search for him and people who know him, there are many articles on paper magazines about him, but if you are too zealous to keep a 9-years-old top-youngster 'cause &quot;well, dear Watson, it fails WP:BIO =_= ahem&quot; let's do it. Do it and stop arguing bullshits. --[[User:Necronudist|necronudist]] 09:24, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

The '''European Federation of [[Financial Analyst]]s Societies''' ('''EFFAS''')[http://www.effas.com] is the federation of [[financial analyst|analysts]] associations in Europe. EFFAS comprises 27 member societies representing more than 14,000 investment professionals. EFFAS was founded in 1962 and the headquarters is located in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]].

Besides its European training programme CEFA (Certified European Financial Analyst) EFFAS also grants the Certified International Investment Analysts (CIIA) designation, ensuring professional qualification by offering global as well as local market knowledge within its examination structure. As a global designation the exams can be taken in different languages. Through the national member societies EFFAS provides a full range of services for capital market experts.

==CIIA Certification==
EFFAS participates in further developing the [[Certified International Investment Analyst]] (CIIA) examinations, a financial analyst designation recognised globally. Analysts who belong to European analyst associations that are members of EFFAS, are eligible to participate in the final CIIA examination, if they pass the foundation and the national exams, or if they hold the Certified European Financial Analyst diploma (CEFA).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Big Andy, (Andrew Walsh) was born in Louisville, Ky., on Feb. 12, 1978.  His father, Frank Walsh and mother, Marsha Sils were overly delighted to have him, since their first son, Patrick, was a dud.  Big Andy was known through his childhood as being pretty funny.  His brother, not so much.  His parents divorced in 1981, after his father recuperated from emergency brain surgery, after falling through the roof at his work and landing head first on the concrete below.  He continued to work there until he passed away after a 3 year battle with melanoma, in 2006, a week before his 54th birthday.  His mom remarried and had another child, a daughter named Brittani (Gamble).</text>

{{Wikipedia subcat guideline|notability criteria|{{PAGENAME}}|[[WP:NMS]]&lt;br&gt;[[WP:SCIENCE]]}}
--&gt;
{{rejected}}

Ideas related to science are an important part of any comprehensive [[WP:ENC|encyclopedia]].  This guideline and its criteria are intended for use in determining whether a topic is notable due to being a part of or related to science.  The tests in this guideline are intended to be fairly rigirous so that a topic that is acceptable under this guideline can be considered an appropriate part of Wikipedia.  However, the failure of a topic to meet this guideline's criteria does not automatically exclude it, as it may attain notability through [[WP:N]] itself or another of its subsidiary guidelines.

==Notability of topics related to science==

The need for this guideline comes from there being a set of topics which do not fail the test of the [[Wikipedia:No original research|No original research]] policy or the [[Wikipedia:Attribution]] policy but which none the less are not appropriate to Wikipedia because they do have sufficient notability.  Such topics mostly represent new findings and theories, as well as past findings and theories that have failed to gain significant attention in either scientific circles or the public at large (or so far failed to gain said attention).

A key element to understanding this guideline is that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a research publication, and as such Wikipedia does not usurp the usual validation processes of scientific institutions such as [[peer review]], [[scientific consensus]], and academic recognition. Decisions about including or excluding material must always reflect the opinions of outside authorities, not those of Wikipedia editors. Inclusion or exclusion is therefore not a judgement on the validity, importance or accuracy of a scientific contribution, but simply a reflection of the quality and quantity of responses it received inside and outside the [[scientific community]].

This [[WP:N|notability guideline]] derives its relevance from the policies [[WP:NOT|What Wikipedia is not]] (in particular [[WP:NOT#IINFO|Not an indiscriminate collection of information]] and [[WP:NOT#CRYSTALBALL|Not a crystal ball]]), [[WP:NOR|No original research]] and [[WP:NPOV|Neutral point of view]] (in particular [[WP:NPOV#Undue weight|Undue weight]] and [[Wikipedia:Neutral point  of view/FAQ#Pseudoscience|Pseudoscience]]), as well as the guidelines [[Wikipedia:Conflict of interest|Conflict of interest]] and [[WP:AUTO|Autobiography]]. Also of importance are [[WP:V|verifiability]] and [[WP:RS|reliability]] policies.

==Criteria==
=== General ===
In general, a contribution in the field of science is notable enough to merit inclusion in Wikipedia if it meets at least one of the following criteria:

#'''Textbook science.''' There is regular non-incidental mention of the contribution in general or specialized textbooks published by reputable presses.{{ref|1|1}}
#'''Widely cited.''' Papers covering the contribution have been widely cited{{ref|2|2}} in its research field{{ref|3|3}} relative to other papers in the same area. Self-citations, and citations in journals which are not respected within the relevant research field should be excluded.
#'''Press and fiction.''' It is or was well known due to extensive press coverage, or due to being a recurrent theme in notable works of [[fiction]]. In this case the article should make note of this status. A single article on the theory, even if from a major media source such as ''[[New Scientist]]'' or ''[[Scientific American]]'', is not a sufficient criterion.
#'''Historical interest.''' It has historically met any of the above criteria within the scientific community or the culture at large but has since either been [[superseded scientific theory|superseded]], disregarded, or dismissed by the scientific community or the culture at large. The article should make note of the subject's status in this regard.
#'''Popular belief.''' It is or was believed to be true by a significant part of the general population, even if rejected by scientific authorities.

Notable topics which are primarily non-scientific in nature but which contain claims concerning scientific phenomena, should not be handled as scientific.  For example, the ''[[Book of Genesis]]'' itself is primarily covered as a religious scripture rather than as a cosmology. On the other hand, subjects such as [[creationism]] or [[creation science]], which involve a direct conflict between scientific and religious doctrine, are properly evaluated both on a scientific and theological basis. Similarly, subjects purporting to have a scientific basis may be noteworthy primarily on cultural or sociological bases, such as UFOs, which can usefully be discussed from several different perspectives.

:{{Seealso|Wikipedia:Notability (science)/Irrelevant arguments}}

===Scientific terms===
:''See also [[Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms]]
A scientific term is considered notable and worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia if the following can be established:
# A commonly agreed-upon formal or informal definition
# A trajectory of use for the term in the scientific literature from [[WP:RS|reliable]] and [[WP:V|verifiable]] sources
To determine notability it is important to keep in mind that different fields sometimes use the same term to describe different concepts. On the other hand, especially in the early stages of a field, terminology is often not standardized and different terms are used for the same concept. The policy on [[WP:NAME|naming conventions]] gives more information on the choice of the proper term when more than one term is used in the scientific literature.

== Assessing the reliability and relevance of sources ==

Journals from which citations and evidence of notability are obtained are expected to be well known and respected within the relevant research field.  The previous requirement of citation from a peer-reviewed source is not alone sufficient by this requirement.  (Peer review is done just as easily by a fringe science journal as by a leading journal, while [[Nature (journal)|Nature magazine]], one of the most respected [[scientific journals]] in existence, uses editorial as well as  peer review for submissions.)

Textbooks should either be well-known and respected or produced by a reputable scientific publisher (which is most likely the same publisher as one or more respected journals).

Journals from scientific societies of developing countries are occasionally not reliable.  If a finding in such a journal should prove to be of great scientific interest, that finding is often reprinted and/or reported in reliable scientific sources.  In such a case, the original journal article can be cited as a primary source, but its relevance should be backed up by secondary citations in known reliable sources.

For biographical articles and articles on fringe science, there is some loosening of these requirements.  Works by the topic of a biographical article are relevant to the article whether their writing was published in a reliable journal/publisher or not.  Also, the contents of a journal devoted to a fringe science can provide evidence as to the past or current thinking within that fringe field.  However, the fringe science journals cannot provide evidence for the outright notability of the topic.

==Notes==
{{note|1|Note 1}}:  The scientific contribution must have a major entry in the work. A passing mention of the concept is not sufficient. 

{{note|2|Note 2}}:  Citation counts and peer review mechanisms differ vastly between sciences, fields, and subfields, and editors are urged to inform the relevant [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Council/Directory/Science|WikiProject]] about ongoing debates to get expert input. It should also be noted that ''quantity'' of citations is often only a poor approximation of ''quality''.

{{note|3|Note 3}}:  A &quot;research field&quot; indicates an established area of study for which the topic in question is only a part.  A topic cannot be its own research field, nor can it gain notability from being part of a field which is non-notable.

__NOTOC__
===Overview===
After much deliberation of the [[Wikipedia:Danny's contest/Contest entries|contest entries]] the judges have arrived at a decision.

The entries could be broken down into three broad groups... entries that didn't seem to have much, if any, improvement, entries that were a &quot;good try&quot; and a handful of entries that really took the contest to heart and added a lot of interesting and germane references.

===Criteria===
The judges graded on 4 major criteria:
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!Criterion
!Description
!Weight
|-
|'''Number of citations'''
|Just a  raw count of how many were added. This was a good filter to see if the article could make the finalists... only 2 or 3 refs suggested that maybe not so much had been done.  
|(20%)
|-
|'''Complexity of citations'''
|A gauge of the difficulty level of adding them. Were they notes? web cites? book cites? did they use ISBN tagging? were there multiple places that got the same note? Notes ON notes? 
|(30%)
|-
|'''Appropriateness of cites'''
|Were they actually GOOD cites that moved the article forward?
|(20%)  
|-
|'''Overall article improvement'''

|'''[[Battle of Ceresole]]'''
|An important battle in medieval history, part of the [[Italian Wars]] series. Characterised by contemporaries as &quot;marvellously confused&quot; this battle is attractively illustrated with lots of maps and diagrams. One would expect Kyrill as coordinator of [[WP:MILHIST]] to do a good job of improving an article, and Kyrill does not disappoint. A very powerful article about an interesting battle.

|'''[[Theramenes]]'''
|An important general and historical figure of ancient Greece, including participating in an Athenian coup, multiple battles, and a rebellion. He even had notoriety after death. The article is challenging due to a paucity of sources, but Robth found 80+ cites. There also is an innovative organisation of sources into modern and ancient. A very good article based on some painstaking research.

|'''[[Crawford expedition]]'''
|A very understudied but important battle in the [[American Revolution]]. The winning side often tends to ignore battles they lost, and this article was not much more than a single paragraph stub when Kevin went to town on it. It is now profusely illustrated with maps, paintings, tables and diagrams and has grown to 43 Kb. In addition to 88 high quality footnotes, it also has a comprehensive &quot;references&quot; and &quot;for further reading&quot; section, properly separated out. All books have good ISBN links. This article is a real tour de force and shows the power of our encyclopedia well.

That all of these articles were somehow military related was surely coincidence! :)

'''Joe Eubanks''' (born 1975) is an [[United States|American]] [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] best known by the [[ring name]] '''Lobo'''. He wrestled primarily in [[Combat Zone Wrestling]] (CZW), where he won every major championship and was the first inductee into the [[CZW Hall of Fame]] in 2004. He was formerly the CZW Commissioner/Talent Coordinator.&lt;ref name=&quot;Online World of Wrestling&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/040207.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling 5th Anniversary Show February 7, 2004 - Philadelphia, Pennsylvania - ECW Arena|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===1999-2002===
Along with [[Nick Gage]], [[Justice Pain]], and [[Ric Blade]], Lobo was trained by [[John Zandig]] at the CZW Wrestling School and graduated first in the class.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freewebs.com/andy_czw1/history.html CZWHookup : The history of CZW] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210134119/http://www.freewebs.com/andy_czw1/history.html |date=2008-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He became one of the main wrestlers in CZW along with other graduates from the school. In February 1999, Lobo became the second [[CZW Iron Man Championship|Iron Man Champion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Online World of Wrestling&quot;/&gt; He held the title until June when he lost it to Justice Pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/990619.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling - CZW Down in Flames June 19, 1999 - Mantua, NJ |accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two continued wrestling each other and competed in the first ever Cage of Death match at the first ''Cage of Death'' show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/991016.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling - CZW Cage of Death October 16, 1999 - Mantua, NJ|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lobo won the match and regained the title. He would lose this title to [[Matt Prince|Wifebeater]], but regain it one more time the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/000311.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling - CZW March Violence March 11, 2000 - Sewell, NJ|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lobo also challenged for the [[CZW World Heavyweight Championship|CZW Heavyweight Championship]]. He feuded with Zandig for the title and finally beat him in July 2000. He held the title until ''Cage of Death II''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/000909.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling - CZW Cage of Death II....After Dark September 9, 2000 - Sewell, NJ|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that show, Lobo successfully defended the championship against Zandig in the Cage of Death match. Directly following this match, Justice Pain came out and fought Lobo in another Cage of Death match. In the match, Lobo was thrown from the top of the cage to the ground through a table covered in barbed wire. Justice Pain went on to win the match and the title.&lt;ref name=&quot;Online World of Wrestling&quot;/&gt;  After losing the title, Lobo continued feuding with Zandig. This time, the feud was for ownership of CZW. On February 9, 2002, Lobo defeated Zandig to become the new owner of CZW. He held this position until ''Cage of Death IV'' when Zandig defeated him to regain his position as CZW's owner &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/021213.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling December 13, 2002 - Philadelphia, PA - Viking Hall|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2003-present===
He took some time off from CZW following the Cage of Death match. While he was gone, a new group called the Hi-V tried to take over CZW, with Zandig as their main target. Zandig was planning to face the Hi-V at ''Cage of Death V'', but the stable outnumbered his team 6 to 4. At ''Night of Infamy II'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/031115.html|title=Night of Infamy II - November 15, 2003 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lobo made a shocking return to help Zandig and join his team just in time for Cage of Death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/031213.html|title=Cage of Death V December 13, 2003 - Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their team was successful. In February 2004, Lobo became the first inductee to the CZW Hall of Fame. After this, Lobo remained inactive for the following two years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Online World of Wrestling&quot;/&gt;

At [[Cage of Death 7]], [[Zandig]], who had turned on the fans, wanted to run CZW the way they used to. He called out Lobo, who was backstage for the event, and they joined each other along with [[Justice Pain]] and [[Nick Gage]]. They would later call themselves the Forefathers of CZW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/_2006/|title=2006 results

*'''Speedy Delete''' - for blatant advertising.  I waited a bit to see how this one would play out before making a decision, but as much good faith as I normally assume, there is no sticking up for this one.  The article's [[User:Kobius|prime editor]] (and incidentally, the forum admin) removed the AfD tag from the page and does not take kindly to other editors touching 'his' page.  The whole layout of the article is clearly trying to draw viewers into the forums, perhaps to meet the admitted goal of 500,000 posts.  Add these to the issues others have pointed out and there's really no need for further discussion.

The Anizone is a large site and I think if someone wants to find out more about it they come to the best internet dictionary in the world and they research on of the largest best sites. The site has a largely amount of fair people considering it has been hacked three times. The admin accidently remoe it thinking it would be delete and he was not the maker of the page but it was I.

==BBC News Report and the pilot &quot;looking for a good place to crash&quot;==

The BBC article states that the pilot was looking for a good place to put the aircraft down; he missed some park and instead put the aircraft down in an uninhabited area near Stockport city centre. The evidence does not justify this supposition whatsoever. For one thing, the AIB report states that the aircraft was likely uncontrollable after the engines cut out, and might not have been controllable even before then. The first officer died and the captain suffered retrograde amnesia, so we don't know what went on in the cockpit. There isn't the tiniest shred of evidence that the pilot &quot;put the aircraft down&quot; someplace safe. It was likely just coincidence - there are a lot of empty or disused areas around airports and under approach paths (and *that* is often deliberate).

This is such a common urban legend/media foofah. Every time a plane doesn't actually fall out of the sky, some media type comes up and says the pilot was &quot;looking for a place to crash that wouldn't cause injuries on the ground&quot;. I don't blame the Wikipedian who put this in at all, because he/she likely didn't have any sources other than the BBC article. I am blaming the BBC for making a supposition not supported by the facts.

I suppose people want to think that in an emergency the first thing the pilot will do is look for a safe place to crash. It makes them feel less worried about an aircraft crashing into their home, school, or place of business. It ain't necessarily so, though; in fact it almost is never so. Aircraft about to crash are more often than not uncontrollable - that's why they crash. --[[User:Charlene.fic|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot; face=&quot;Matisse ITC&quot;&gt;Charlene&lt;/font&gt;]] 19:40, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

Edited to add: The cause of the accident wasn't &quot;pump failure&quot; (boo, BBC, again). It was a design error in the fuel line. --[[User:Charlene.fic|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot; face=&quot;Matisse ITC&quot;&gt;Charlene&lt;/font&gt;]] 20:02, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

:Apologies. That would have been my factual faux pas. Thank you for correcting my blathering and making this article respectable. :) [[User:Legion89|Legion]] 13:56, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

A second's more flight and the plane would catastrophically have taken the tower off Stockport's fine Town Hall and crashed into the facade of the (then) infirmary opposite the Town Hall, blocking the main road between that runs from Manchester through Stockport to the south - AG, Stockport.

== Additional cause of this crash ==

I remember seeing a BBC program about this crash. It reported on the findings of the inquiry. It said that there was an additional reason for the crash.

Apparently, the engine speeds were shown in the cockpit on two dials, one for each wing. Each dial had two hands, one for each engine and each labelled with the engine number.

This had been serviced, and a mistake had been made so that engine 3 was connected to the hand marked &quot;4&quot;, and engine 4 to hand &quot;3&quot;.

I think it was engine 4 that was starved of fuel. The pilot saw from the dial that engine 3 had stopped, so he switched off / feathered engine 3. Now both engines on the right wing were out. (This would explain why engine 4 was windmilling.)

As part of the investigation, they tried flying a similar aircraft with engines 3 and 4 both out, and discovered that the aircraft could not be flown properly.

Now, I mention all this because it is an interesting story. Also, because I want to apply the moral to setting up a computer cluster. I want to avoid the possibility of one computer failing and a different one being taken out for service by mistake, thereby bringing down the cluster. 

Does anyone know more about this? [[User:Mm67|Mm67]] 11:44, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

==Is [[Wikipedia:Notability (science)]] a consensus guideline?==
Please state your position, '''yes''' or '''no''', explain your position and defend it.  This is not a vote.  [[User:SmokeyJoe|SmokeyJoe]] 10:47, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Yes''' I consider it one, and I'm not sure what objection people have - if there's a problem that needs fixing, let's fix it.  I already refer to it, guideline or not, since it's very useful.  --[[User:Minderbinder|Minderbinder]] 12:38, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Yes''' Not only is it a consensus guideline, it is absolutely vital for Wikipedia to have such a guideline. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 12:51, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Yes''' I certainly support this guideline, what it is trying to do, and how it is trying to achieve it. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:10, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Yes''' We're ready to go into the stage where changes should be discussed here before being implemented in the policy page. ~ [[User:Trialsanderrors|trialsanderrors]] 17:40, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Absolutely''' We've numerous AfDs and arbcom cases which have documented that this is the community's intent. --[[User:EngineerScotty|EngineerScotty]] 17:44, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* I don't see where the proposed criteria add meaningful advice to writters or evaluators, and the preamble/text is way too long to be practical.  Please cite some examples of AfD where this proposal would have ensured an outcome other than what would have been achieved under the current guidelines.  For each of the criteria now listed I belive that proper application of WP:N and WP:ATT would acheive the same results.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 17:54, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
** There is [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Electric universe (concept)]], where this standard helped to refine the arguments that finally got the topic removed.  The aupporters trying to use this guideline to buoy their cause ended up only showing all the more that the article did not belong in Wikipedia.  &lt;br&gt;You are correct that in the end articles that are removed will be so removed (or not) due to policy concerns.  The need for this guideline comes from its ability to focus the debate on the issues that are important in the relevant cases.  In other words, it helps to achieve the &quot;proper application&quot; that you are claiming makes this guideline irrelevant. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 18:22, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
*** EMS, could your purpose be acheived with an essay?  Among the problems with permutations from guidelines and policies is the evolution into redundant and conficting guidance to the point that writers and evaluators become confused and the branches work at cross purposes.  My frequent analogy is the US Tax Code, which has bread several large industries for interpretation and application.  Writing complex rule sets requires great skill and caution. --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 18:34, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
*** On review of the Electric universe (concept) AfD, it appears to be resoundingly rejected with the tools we already have, most convincingly original research and few reliable sources.  This outcome is consistent with other scientific and academic issues which I have seen defeated at AfD. An excellent nomination doesn't hurt either! --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 18:42, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
**** Right now I am wondering what your agenda is here, as this type of opposition usually comes from someone who has lost an AfD in part due to this and the guidelines and is seeking to water down the standards.  One of the factors that helped with the electric universe AfD was the the nominator was also working on this guideline and used its insights in writing the nom.  Beyond that, there is the basic issue of moving beyond &quot;peer review&quot; as a standard for inclusion, a test passed by numerous non-notable articles that I have seen.  Also, I at least have gone to some pains to couch this as a setting standard for inclusions instead of exclusion.  That way, an argument that &quot;X calls for inclusion&quot; renders this guideline moot as a refutation, and so avoids the types of conflicts that in our laws make being a lawyer such a profitable profession. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 19:16, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
***** My agenda is not as you assert, but your question is a fair one, which I will answer.  My agenda is clarity in the grand scheme of notability guidelines, without a specific prejudice to this proposal. Please visit the discussion page for WP:N to see that there are many people expressing concerns over the whole process.  I support the concept of &quot;encyclopedic suitability&quot;, which we call notablility at WP, for lack of a better name.  I also consider myself a moderate inclusionist.  I am a frequent participant in Afd.  You are correct in one respect, that I origninally became involved in AfD and notability, because I saw too many abuses by uninformed editors who were deleting meanigful articles, though not specifically in the field of science.  My interest is in history and sailing.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 19:33, 16 March 2007 (UTC) 
******Might I recommend that your &quot;no&quot; comment seems to be motivated more by a general dislike for [[WP:N]] rather than a specific distaste for this particular guideline. In particular, the motivation behind this guideline was in part due to a charge made during the [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Pseudoscience|Pseudoscience arbitrartion case]] that such a guideline should exist to fend off charges related to whether an idea was notable in a scientific sense. One can argue whether [[WP:N]] should exist or not, but that's not for us to decide here. It is absolutely not true that this guideline is redudant: there is no other place where it is indicated what makes a scientific idea notable for inclusion in the encyclopedia. [[WP:NOR]] doesn't help because &quot;originality&quot; is a vague concept related to heavily to [[WP:V]] and [[WP:COI]] to be useful when people just make random articles about ostensibly scientific subjects they read about online, for example. [[WP:A]] doesn't help because there are scientific ideas which are not notable (the general consensus of the community is that they do not belong in the encyclopedia) which nevertheless are attributable to reliable sources. [[WP:NPOV]] doesn't work because the exclusion criteria at [[WP:NPOV#Undue weight]] is unable to distinguish between majority and minority except by [[WP:CON|consensus]]. That's why this guideline is needed and why it is used. Look at all the pages that link here and tell me that it isn't referred to. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 13:09, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
* No, it's not.  I think the burden of some evidence that this guideline is widely supported and necessary needs to be shown from the supporters.  Right now it's an initiative, a proposal with stable wording.  However, even in the &quot;test cases&quot; that I looked at, it seems that this guideline isn't being referred to, and evaluation of the articles in question isn't done with these guidelines in mind, rather, articles are mainly evaluated from a point of view of adequate sourcing and original research issues, in other words, policies we already have.  (I do think the editors here have reached a reasonably stable consensus, though.  But that doesn't, to me, make a &quot;consensus guideline,&quot; which implies support from the community overall.)[[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:04, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
**The evidence is in the ''What links here'' tool you can access from the toolbox. I think that you may have a hidden agenda here: you tend to be a bit too quick to agree to a supression bias against non-experts in the fields of science. Is this a misplaced concern? --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 13:09, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
***First of all there are over 150 things that link to [[Wikipedia:Notability (science)]], so it's not unreasonable to expect evidence to be actually gathered by someone trying to make a case.  But more, I went to a few of those &quot;what links here&quot; and apparently the only reason they were linked was that trialsanderrors mentioned that the debate was a test case: not people actually referring to the guideline and trying to use it.  Look at the Electric Universe AfD, for instance, which is the best example I've seen of a borderline-notable scientific theory (where this guideline might help).  [[WP:SCIENCE]] was not used as an argument in the debate, even by you, and the arguments that led to it being deleted were not even much along the lines of what is presented here in the guideline, but were according to core Wikipedia policies like [[WP:ATT]], [[WP:OR]] and so on.  Some of the argument is covered here in the introduction, but the &quot;criteria&quot; part played no role and seems to be central to this as a notability guideline.  So, this is what I mean when I say that no evidence has been presented.  What do YOU mean when you say this is a consensus guideline?  [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:43, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
****The criteria part played a huge role. The only criteria that EU could have come close to satisfying was recognition in popular culture/outside media and we showed that it was not notable along those lines. The guidelines at the time were being formulated and weren't as clear as they are now, but thanks to discussions such as that AfD we have a clearer demarcation. I think you need to read through the AfD we reference again and look carefully at how the criteria line-up with the criteria outlined in this guideline. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:02, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
*****Could you show me precisely where?  I don't mean to be dense, but I really don't see it.  I see your point #5 in the nomination, but that sounds like the core [[WP:N]] argument, and not related to the criteria here.  And anyway, saying the the EU debate influenced [[WP:SCIENCE]] kind of precludes that the EU debate can be thought of as evidence that this is a consensus guideline.  Can you show me ANY AfD debate that explicitly references the criteria?  [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:17, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
******Number 5 in the nomination. While it doesn't explicitly reference this page, it does so implicitly (and if I recall correctly at the time the standards were still being developed as to which criteria were going to be grouped with which). --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:20, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
*******Again, #5 was really along the lines of basic [[WP:N]].  Again, show me any debates that explicitly reference the criteria.  There's a difference between this proposal being wise or balanced or sensible and it having ''broad community support.''  [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:44, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
********Basic [[WP:N]]&quot;? That's a bit of WikiLawyering I haven't come across before. The fact is that #5 has direct parallels to our criteria here. You can thrust your head in the sand over this all you want, but that's the plain truth of the matter. And now you reposition your attack to claim that there isn't &quot;broad community support&quot;, but let me remind you that arbcomm members entreatied the community to develop these standards in the first place and that by virtue of this being a Wiki it will end up as balanced and sensible as possible. I'm beginning to think you are being a stick-in-the-mud for reasons you aren't coming clean about. Help me out, explain to me why you always seem to be fighting against scientific accuracy at Wikipedia so I can [[WP:AGF|assume good faith]] towards your contributions. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 17:36, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
***I suggest you go read [[WP:AGF]] and actually take it to heart.  In our current discussion, you seem to have trouble differentiating between (1) my personal support or opposition of the proposal and (2) my arguing that the proposal isn't a &quot;consensus guideline&quot;, that is, that it doesn't have broad support.  This wouldn't be a very hard difference to understand if you had been assuming good faith of me in the first place.  For the record, I support some of what the proposal says but not all of it, but that wasn't the basis for my objections: calling the proposal a &quot;consensus guideline&quot; is wrong, because this is still a very new proposal, barely even stable enough to judge.  [[WP:PROF]] remained a proposal for a very long time, and finally became a guideline when it became apparent that the guideline had influenced the way decisions were being made, and that the community, de facto, embraced the guideline.  Creation of policies and guidelines is slow and for good reason, especially when actionable changes are being proposed (like the criteria here).

****I appreciate your candor regarding your opinions of the content of this guideline because that is precisely what concerns me. However, I do feel that you are being a bit oblique in your commentary. &quot;Policy creation is slow,&quot; is often the cry of those who want to slow things down, and people tend to drag their feet for a reason. To me and many of the other editors who commented above, this guideline is ''de facto'' in place and isn't a proposal because we as editors abide by it. As you know, Wikipedia policies and guidelines are not written to affect change in the encyclopedia, but rather are meant to describe what actively goes on in editing. A good number of those who say that this is a consensus guideline edit a lot of science-related articles and so should be the ones to tell whether or not this guideline applies. I don't see that you are actively doing this as such. I do see you stepping into disputes regarding science-related articles often, and there are many times I see these actions as being in something of a contravention of the guidelines outlined here. I am being very up-front about my distrust of your motivations, but in so doing I'm also trying to assume good-faith as much as I can. Part of assuming good-faith is being transparent about one's perceptions and I'm offering you the opportunity to explain yourself as transparently as possible so we can move on. I don't like being lectured about [[WP:AGF]] when I was the one who brought it up, it looks to me like you are asking me to turn a blind eye towards our long history here at the encyclopedia and I am honestly telling you I'm having a hard time doing it because of the nature of this particular dispute we're having. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 13:53, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
*****You are making false implications about me, and I want it to stop.  [[WP:CIV|Comment on my comments]].  You say this is an attempt to document how Wikipedia works?  I respectfully disagree -- this talk page and its archives are full of debates about what the criteria ''should'' be, with very little discussion or analysis of how things are actually decided now.  (Some, but not much.)  From perusing the test cases, it seems to me that people are nearly exclusively deciding on these cases on the basis of [[WP:OR]], [[WP:ATT]], and [[WP:NPOV]], (and to a degree, [[WP:N]]), without much need for arguments specific to issue that the topics under discussion are scientific ones.  Since that ''isn't'' the content of this proposal, I cannot agree that this is documenting current Wikipedia practice, but if you want to try to change my mind, please show me specific examples so we can discuss them.  In any case, you should advertise this debate on [[WP:VPR]]; the general Wikipedia community should have a chance to comment.

******Whether they are false or not, they are simply my questions regarding your, frankly, obstinate resistance to this particular document. I am trying to be as forthright as possible here, and your increasingly haughty responses only confuse me further since you still haven't addressed directly my concerns regarding the history we have surrounding issues such as this. I disagree that the discussions are centering around how things &quot;should&quot; be. Rather I see discussions centering around generalizing from the experience that editors have. You also seem to be under the opinion that just because people reference older and more established policies and guidelines they aren't also considering this guideline. This I find to be particularly problematic because it ignores the words of people that aren't appended with a WP-acronym. Just because somebody doesn't cite this directly doesn't mean that you can't see the criteria being applied (as per our earlier discussion on EU deletion). I would hope that you would look more closely at the deletion discussions surrounding this and see if you can't spot the criteria in action. I am not going to advertise the debate anywhere, but you are free to do so. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 16:27, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
*******I've advertised the debate at [[WP:VPR]].  In terms of the status: you see one thing, I see another thing.  I'm not going to change my opinion by simply being told &quot;please look more closely,&quot; although you could convince me if you actually showed me some evidence.  I do see a lot of attempts at guiding the community: take a look at [[#&quot;Conference topic&quot; is a backdoor]], for instance, or [[#One final thought]]: people are discussing how to make a good rule, not what the rule is, organically.

****I'm with SA here: [[WP:N]] is being criticized partly because of its extreme generality.  No reason to think the entire idea of notability for all topics must pause just because of that.

****  The problem lies less with any individual sub-guideline, but more with a plethora of permutations leading to confusion.

***** I don't see any bedlam here.  I see this as being a well crafted guideline that is dealing with issues which are out-of-scope for the more general guideline due to its broad nature.  This guideline deals with the issues of science and science-related topics, and how to implement the notability guidelines within that context.&lt;br&gt;I have looked at the [[WP:N]] discussion and I get the feeling that you are doing your best to create uncertainty and confusion there.  And now you are trying to do the same here.  I for one have no need for it, and support this guideline as a reflection of the legitimate sense of the science editors here as to what is valid. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 18:23, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
*Yes, this appears to be a consensus guideline. The opposition to this guideline proposal may be part of a campaign in which User:Kevin Murray in the past month has placed &quot;rejected&quot; , &quot;disputed&quot; , or &quot;historical&quot; , or &quot;essay&quot; labels on about a dozen notability proposals or guidelines or has nominated them for deletion on the grounds that there was no consensus or that they constituted &quot;instruction creep&quot; or were redundant. A proposal is not necessarily impossible to reach consensus upon just because a few editors oppose it.

** I see your point.  This editor really, really has a grudge against the concept of notability, and I would love to know why.  If you want to do a [[WP:RfC]] against him, I am will be happy to second it.  This is ridiculous. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 19:42, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
*** No EMS, this editor, has a &quot;grudge&quot; against needless and redundant rule making for the sake of rule making.  I strongly support the concept of encyclopedic suitability which we call &quot;notability&quot; at WP.  This is not &quot;ridiculous&quot; but based on observations from life experience, that too many conficting rules create confusion rather than clarity.  Complex rule-sets require incredible cross coordination among the permutations, which is not happening here at WP, as guidelines are multiplying like rabbits without consideration of the big picture.  If you propose an RfC, please do so in the best interest of WP, not &quot;against&quot; me; this is not personal and reviewing the discussions will reveal that my actions are well supported.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 14:18, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
****There are plenty of Wikipedians who [[WP:IAR|agree with you about hating rules]]. However, might I suggest that you are going about it the wrong way. We are here writing this guideline because we need to summarize what has been done in regards to this issue. Your own personal distaste for the way in which editors have gone about doing this is probably best argued elsewhere: it certainly has nothing to do with whether consensus exists for this particular guideline. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:29, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
*** I do not see '''any''' need to coordinate this guideline with any other guidelines beside [[WP:N]] itself.  Although I am doing my own &quot;[[WP:NOR|original research]]&quot;, I have seem enough -uh- &quot;stuff&quot; offered by others such that I see a need to draw a firm and reasonable as to what is and is not acceptable here.  Until it has some reasonable amount of recognition in the scientific community, I see an article on my ideas as being an abuse of Wikipedia.  Yet I am unusual in that most other editors of Wikipedia with alternate ideas are here to promote those ideas, and they hate guidelines like this one with a purple passion because they help to keep their OR out.&lt;br&gt;BTW - I do see where you have had some success with you anti-Notability campaign.  Personally I think that you are doing Wikipedia a real disservice with it, and what you are stifling is not a bunch useless rule-making but instead needed elaborations on the meaning of Notability in various domains.  As has been noted in [[Wikipedia_talk:Notability|the WP:N discussion]], there is a level of subjectiveness in determining notability.  The need for these subsidary guidelines is to limit that subjectiveness, and thereby make this concept more usable.  Instead you are trying to pull the rug out from under Notability, something that will make the removal of questionable material much more difficult than it should be. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 16:08, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''the real test''' is whether the guidelines here will be accepted in practice. Both the above positions are to some degree correct: the guideline should reflect what its eds. believe to be the common feeling of the community, but it shouldalso point in the direction of where the consensus appears to be moving, and to be making recommendations from those most involved in edited these articles to guide thos less familiar. I think it will prove to be accepted because it is relatively straightforward, not complex -- at least by comparison -- and, in my view it does reflect the general voice. But we shall see. 
::The real dispute , I think, is over the notability of fringe science and whether that can be considered science in any sense at all. This is a matter in which I think there is in fact no real consensus, but at best a temporary majority, and i expect this  question to continue to be the theme of AfDs. I don't think this guideline  lays it to rest '''[[User:DGG|DGG]]''' 23:36, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
::: This guideline cannot and should not judge whether something is &quot;real science&quot;.  In fact, all that a determination that something is &quot;not science&quot; can do here is to remove a topic from being judged by this criteria with no resolution on its notability or lack thereof.  IMO, we have a set of criteria here such that anything that is meant to be judged as part of science can be ruled on here, be it mainstream or fringe.  What I think that you will find is that the least palatable topics are those which also have had the least impact and are also therefore the least notable.  --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 01:53, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

== Some suggestions on organizing this project page ==

* The introduction is too long.  Limit it to &quot;what&quot; and &quot;why&quot;.  Get the commentary (i.e. &quot;impetus&quot;) and discussion of process into its own section.  Specifically address what makes ''science'' different from other areas covered by the general guidelines.
* Criteria should define at least these categories as guidance to editors:
** topics which on their face should be include (i.e. the notable)
** topics which are going to require some judgments to be made by editors if they are new articles or added to existing articles. (i.e. the maybe notable)
** topics which, at least according to the authors of the guideline, are ''improbably'' included. (i.e. nonnotable)
* The statement ''&quot;Decisions about including or excluding material must always reflect the opinions of outside authorities, not those of Wikipedia editors.&quot;'' is bizarre because the opinion of Wikipedia editors is what, by definition, compose the Wikipedia. ''&quot;Must always&quot;'' is a rather strange term to be found in a mere ''guideline'' at any rate. [[User:Patsw|patsw]] 13:22, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

:: If you wish to draft an alternate version, the feel free to do so ''elsewhere'' and present it to us as a possible replacement.  We are certainly amenable to productive changes.  However, IMO the current project page works and should be considered a functioning guideline. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:13, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
:I agree the ''reflect outside authorities'' wording is odd (although not any odder than &quot;notability is not subjective&quot; which expresses the [[WP:ATT|same sentiment]]). The rest doesn't strike me as an improvement. ~ [[User:Trialsanderrors|trialsanderrors]] 17:49, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

::One point that isn't being made (in the intro) and probably should be is the point that scientific theories cannot be properly presented without understanding their level of acceptance.  There's a big difference between a mainstream theory and a fringe theory, and even in an article about a fringe theory, it's important to describe it as one.  However, for some fringe theories, insufficient sources exist to back up the claim that they are fringe theories.  Thus we are left with only one real choice: disallow the article, as we cannot properly cover it while adhering to [[WP:ATT]] and [[WP:NPOV]].  This is different from, say, an article about a band, where it may be that no source reports on their popularity or number of fans accurately, but sources do report on other things: the information we can't cover can just be left out.  In articles on science, we really can't leave that out.  [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:41, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

:::The &quot;level of acceptance&quot; argument makes no sense to me. &quot;Theory&quot; in science has a very precise meaning which applies to models and descriptions which are as completely accepted as possible in an endeavor based primarily on the dubious activity of inductive reasoning. While there is a big difference between mainstream and fringe proposals, the proposals themselves are only considered &quot;theories&quot; when they pass the tests of the scientific method. What makes a proposal fringe is, ostensibly, its inability to pass these tests. This doesn't mean that scientists don't make mistakes in pejoratively labeling the fringe out of the mainstream, only to say that the level of acceptance is something of a binary operator: either it's in or it's out. When an idea does not generate enough interest in the scientific community to create commentary from members of the community, it must either be uncontroversial (as is the case with textbook knowledge) or it must be outside the scientific community. This is quite easy to verify. No amount of posturing and insisting on the part of a fringe idea's proponents that the idea is actually &quot;scientific&quot; is good enough when demarcating for our purposes. We might still have articles on the idea if there is &quot;extra-scientific&quot; interest in it, but we do not need to shy away from being honest about its &quot;extra-scientific&quot; nature. One of the problems that many pro-fringe editors have is that they believe that because [[negative proof|proving the negative]] is in principle a defiance of [[WP:ATT]] that reasonable editors can't make editorial judgments with regards to the status of a particular idea. This is simply not the case at all: we are editing an encyclopedia not compiling a list of sources. After all, that's why we have editors in the first place: we are charged with summarizing the available data in the most conformist way possible. When all the data is outside the scientific community and the idea purports to have scientific importance, it is perfectly fine to delineate the contradiction. However, this discussion is probably better suited for [[WP:FRINGE]]. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:09, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

*I think it is a little more complicated than that.
*It is not ''necessary'' to give an indication of the acceptance of a theory, in order to describe it.
*And I don't think the word &quot;theory&quot; has such a precise meaning as scientists would like. For example, Wikipedia calls the [[Big Bang]] a &quot;theory&quot;, whereas the Encyclopedia Britannic calls it a &quot;Model&quot;. And I am sure there are more sources supporting both.
*This is why the new [[WP:A]] is so important. I can attribute both the Big Bang Theory, and the Big Bang Model, but I can find no source which agues it must be one or the other.
*I can also find no attribution labelling many minority subjects as &quot;fringe&quot;, nor claiming a certain level of acceptance. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 17:47, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

== Making this an approved guideline ==

I notice that Kevin Murray has downgraded this guideline back to the &quot;proposed&quot; status.  I would revert that myself, except that I am not at all clear by what action/authority it became considered a functioning guideline.  Certainly the above poll has produced only five people who support this as a guideline.  Even without the two nay-sayers I fail to see how the five of us constitute a group that can speak for the Wikipedia community as a whole, or at least the science editors.

I for one do call for the issue of approving this as a functioning guideline be presented to the community as a whole.  [[Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)|the Village Pump policy forum]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Science|WikiProject Science]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Physics|WikiProject Physics]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Chemistry|WikiProject Chemistry]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Biology|WikiProject Biology]] are all places where this guideline can be advertised and input and approval sought.  I see little danger in this and much promise, but mostly I would like to be able to show Kevin a formal approval so that is downgrading of this guideline cannot occur again. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 02:17, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

::We don't do &quot;formal&quot; and &quot;official&quot; with respect to guidelines. What matters is if this is (1) a good idea and (2) used as such in practice.

Judged by this talk page and AFD, the answer to all three is 'yes', so this page is a de facto guideline and Kevin is the lone dissenter here. Of course, putting a notice on the village pump never hurts.

:::Kevin is not the only dissenter, I also am.  Let me enumerate some general criticisms, this time relating to the substance of the proposal.  1.  There is not a big need for this.  Most science articles up for deletion are up for other concerns than notability, primarily, concerns that the article is original research, POV, or inadequately sourced.  Although there are many debates on the test pages subpage, in very few was the critical issue the notability of the subject: [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Electric universe (concept)]], [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Socionomics]], and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Growing Earth Theory]] (and the old debates, not listed there, about [[Time Cube]]).  2.  The list of criteria, a core part of this proposal, were not used as the basis of successful arguments in any of the key examples I listed.  Rather, the test seems to be the general one of being covered in multiple independent sources, inside or outside of the scientific community.  Note that the criteria give an opportunity to supporters of OR articles (real OR, not neutral attempts at describing published research) to argue for inclusion inappropriately: see [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sorce theory]] as an example of this.  The criteria have changed since then, but the same kind of argument could be made today.  I wouldn't want to jeopardize any of those debates by having a guideline here with such minimal applicability.  3.  The list of criteria is instruction creep and isn't useful.  For articles that should be deleted, not meeting the criteria doesn't make a strong argument.  For articles that should be kept, they're okay, but arguments to delete things that meet these criteria are weak delete arguments in the first place, usually along the lines of &quot;this article is in bad shape&quot;, see [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ubiquitous computing]] for example.  The criteria seem aimed at solving a non-existant problem of the over-deletion of notable science topics.

*The fundamental flaw of [[WP:SCIENCE|Notability (science)]], is that it tries to determine only whether an article is '''scientifically''' notable. It does not consider whether an article may be notable in '''any''' other area.

*: This is a true red herring IMO.  A failure of scientific notability does not mean that an article may have notability in another manner and therefore be worthy of inclusion.  I did have wording here to that effect at one time, but it seems to have been lost.  I will see to restoring that, as I see this guideline as being usable only as a means of inclusion.  For the purposes of exclusion, the failure of a topic to merit inclusion under any guideline (including this one) is the relevant matter. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:27, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
*:  (Edit conflict) Agree with EMS; The page clearly embraces the idea that popular notability for science topics is appropriate.  Since popular notability definitely is acceptable (see the [[Time Cube]] precedent, for instance), any wording that implies otherwise should be examined.  But you aren't correctly representing the main thrust of the proposal.

::*I did not suggest that failing scientific notability means that an article MUST be notable elsewhere. I wrote that it MAY be notable elsewhere. Yet the current policy does not consider this.
::*Deleting articles based on scientific notability alone, is an incredible conceit, and should play no part of the proposed guidelines. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 17:35, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
:::*I'm not sure what your point is.  If an article is scientifically notable, fine, it's keepable.  If an article is not notable scientifically, but notable in some other way (for example, in popular culture), fine, it's keepable.  But if the article is not notable in any way at all, why should it be kept?

::::*A number of articles have already been deleted, based on whether they were scientifically notable only, or worse, ''mainstream'' scientifically notable.

:::::* So what?  I see this as something that can and should happen.  If no other grounds are being offerred to justify notability, then the article should go.  I would point out that the deleted items cited as being &quot;non-mainstream&quot; are also considered &quot;non-notable&quot;, while other items have been kept as being &quot;notable&quot; but &quot;fringe&quot;.  It seems to me that this shows that this is a reasonable and workable scheme. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 22:09, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

::::::*No other grounds for notability are offered because the articles are considered only as to whether they are scientifically notable.
::::::*For example, the article on [[Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Ralph_Juergens|Ralph Juergens was deleted]] (a) based on a Scientific notability &quot;test case&quot; (b) on the grounds that he was a &quot;non-notable non-mainstream scientist&quot;, which is accurate, but no cause for deletion by itself.
::::::*It is improper for &quot;Notability (science)&quot; to '''solely''' judge any article for deletion, as it makes no attempt to attract expert editors in other fields --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 23:12, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

:::::::* If you are saying that a deleted article had another non-scince reason for being notable, then please name it and indicate why that reason was not considered at the time.  Also do note that in such cases a request for reconsideration can be made to [[Wikipedia:Deletion review]].  However, this standard is for determining notability with respect to science, and I find it to be quite silly and disingenuous to accuse this guideline of not doing something that it is not meant to so (namely seeking non-science-related reasons for inclusion). --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 01:56, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

::::::::* Ian, I hear you.  However your objections are ''way'' off base here, because what you don't like is that a consensus of Wikipedia editors has disagreed with your stance on certain topics.  That doesn't really have any bearing on whether or not that consensus exists.  You talk like [[WP:SCIENCE]] got Ralph Juergens deleted: no.  A consensus of editors and a discussion got it deleted, and frankly, it wasn't even based on [[WP:SCIENCE]] at all, more like on [[WP:BIO]] or [[WP:PROF]].

:::::::::*No, I am criticizing the make-up of the consensus, which is predominantly science-oriented editors who decided that Ralph Juergens was not notable because he was not a mainstream scientists; That is what the summary says. The AfD was not targeted outside of Notability (Science).
:::::::::*The main reason given for deletion of &quot;Ralph Juergens&quot; was that he &quot;is only published by vanity presses&quot;; not only is this false, but it fails civility guidelines,[[WP:COI#Importance_of_civility]]. Nevertheless, this was picked up by several other editors as their reasons for supporting the AfD.
:::::::::*But this is not the place to discuss a single article, but I offer this as an example. 
:::::::::*I think it is wholly inappropriate for WP:SCI to advertise articles for deletion. WP:NOTABLE should advertise AfD, giving a editors a chance to refer to WP:SCI and OTHER notability guidelines. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 10:46, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

==One researcher POV fails NPOV==
*The third paragraph includes an incorrect statement:
:&quot;the point of view of one researcher or research term and, unless it generates a significant outside response by the scientific community or the population at large, fails NPOV&quot;
*This is a complete misunderstanding of [[WP:NPOV|NPOV]]. If we attribute a statement to a single researcher, and it conforms to [[WP:A]] and is not misrepresented, then it conforms to NPOV. The argument is whether a statement by a single researchers is ''notable'', which is completely different. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 19:26, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

::*If another attributable view is available, we describe it. If it isn't, we don't pretend there might be one. There is no double whammy.
::*Describing the POV of one person does not automatically fail NPOV, and any decent editor can describe any POV in way that fulfils NPOV.
::*Quashing a POV on the grounds that there MIGHT be a hypothetical counter-POV, fails NPOV, fails WP:A, and fails WP:V. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 00:08, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

:::::*The only requirement to provide a balanced view, is if one exists. If it doesn't, then to pretend that a view &quot;needs balancing&quot;, is presumably based on the view of an unattributable, anonymous, expert-less editor. This fails numerous Wikipedia policies.

:::::*Yet both POVs are EQUALLY valid, as long as they are not misrepresented, and can easily be described in a manner that conforms to NPOV. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 13:15, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

:::::::What you fail to realize is that there is an informal community discussion as well as a formal publication discussion. Those who are in a particular community are aware of the informal discussion and are able to tell when a topic is ignored/scoffed or when it is accepted. This cannot be reported at Wikipedia for verifiability reasons, but it still raises NPOV concerns when certain editors try to force obscure research into the forefront of an article. You are mistaking a standard of verifiability (which is the standard for how to write an article) with editorial judgement: they need not be one-in-the-same. In other words, one need not &quot;verify&quot; that there is NPOV issues because, as editors, our editorial opinions do not need to be (nor can they be) verified. The only thing that needs to be verifiable is the text of the article. We are allowed to have judgements that are external to this. As such, it is perfectly reasonable to say that there are NPOV problems with someone citing a single, isolated, though published research paper. In terms of your dark matter red herring, you have totally misconstrued the situation, and I'm fairly confident that nearly any third party not firmly ensconced in pathological skepticism toward mainstream astrophysics would find your evaluation predictably myopic. Clowe's triumphalist attitude is only justified from the standpoint of [[standing on the shoulders of giants]]. It's not like he was publishing his &quot;proof&quot; of dark matter in a vacuum -- it was a particular point that was addressed to a particular (MOND-type) objection. However, when your hypothetical John Doe bucks the established research by publishing proof against dark matter, he is publishing in a vacuum. Prof. John Doe's work is marginal and therefore marginalized by Wikipedia. Clowe's work is mainstream and therefore reported by Wikipedia. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:47, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
::::::::SA is quite right about verifiability vs. editorial judgement.  However, I have to say I worry when editorial judgement of this type comes into dispute.  Wikipedia needs sources for two reasons: one is to have attributions in the articles, but another reason is that it levels the playing field in editorial discussions.  Inherently, experts on Wikipedia are not set above ordinary editors, but they may be more familiar with the subject in question.  But experts have to prove themselves, just like anyone else.  Fundamentally, Wikipedia is a community of equal editors.  So, this is a good argument ''for'' [[WP:SCIENCE]]: in order to avoid having to rely on editorial judgement too heavily, we look for a higher standard of quality in sources for scientific topics, and where that doesn't exist, we should avoid covering the subject.

:::::::::*Let's not mix up NPOV and editorial judgment. As I said earlier, the statement in the introduction is incorrect concerning NPOV. I also said it may concern notability, so I'm not dismissing the point. But let's be accurate as editors.
:::::::::*The idea that a community has informal discussions which a particular editor may be aware, is worthless. It is not verifiable, nor attributable. 
:::::::::*I know THREE different communities, all of whom have informal discussions, and promise peer reviewed papers that I could mention too. Also worthless.
:::::::::*An encyclopedia does not run on material gleaned from Chinese whispers via anonymous, unaccountable editors.
:::::::::*I had previously brought this up at the Neutrality Project, see &quot;[[Wikipedia_talk:Neutrality_Project#NPOV_misunderstanding|NPOV misunderstanding]]&quot;. They agree. A singular POV can be described in an NPOV manner. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 16:01, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

NPOV is inherently based in editorial judgement. The only way that someone determines whether there is a problem with NPOV is by making an editorial judgement. That's why the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{POV}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag comes with the wording it does. Disputes arise between editors over NPOV: if there was a singular editor there would never be NPOV issues from the standpoint of writing an article. While I agree with Mangojuice that editors are judged external to their status as &quot;experts&quot; (see ongoing conflicts over [[WP:EXPERT]] for example), the community doesn't deny the existence of experts either. No one is saying that the encyclopedia should be &quot;run&quot; on expert judgement or the whispers of whatever anonymous and unaccountable ethnic group, but people are saying that editors may come to the table with these concerns. That's the essence of the NPOV guideline: all the points-of-view are placed on the table and the marginalization happens per the outside community and references to the outside world. No one is saying that a singular POV cannot be described, but people are saying that singular POVs present unique difficulties when writing an encyclopedia that is supposed to be NPOV. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 17:39, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

:*Indeed, all the POVs are placed on the table. And if there is just one POV (because there is one WP:V/WP:RS/WP:A), then we can still write that POV so that it conforms to NPOV, regardless of whether you or I or anyone else agrees with the POV, and regardless of whether it is mainstream of pseudoscience.
:*In which case, the statement in the third paragraph that I described above, is incorrect. A view from a single researcher may fail a criteria, but there is no reason for it to fail NPOV; and if it does, any decent editor can re-write it so that it conforms to NPOV. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 19:19, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
:::If there is only one notable POV, then sure, we write about it. In which case the statement in the third paragraph is correct. A view from a single research written about on Wikipedia does have editorial issues related to NPOV for the reasons delineated because the alternatives may exist but cannot be included without falling into original research. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 19:23, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
::::*The statement is incorrect because a single POV does not fail NPOV unless it is written badly, in which case any competent editor can correct it. Sure, the statement may be allowed because it is notable. But it won't fail because of NPOV.
::::*A single POV that has been published elsewhere does not not fail &quot;Original research&quot;, because [[WP:NOR]] &quot;refers to '''unpublished''' facts&quot;. (my emphasis) --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 19:51, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

You are missing the point. Perhaps I should post here the statement that you dispute:

:''Research published in a reputable publication passes these thresholds but reflects the point of view of one researcher or research term and, unless it generates a significant outside response by the scientific community or the population at large, focusing on such research in a Wikipedia article does not adequately conform to [[WP:NPOV|Wikipedia's policy on neutrality]], in particular the section on [[WP:NPOV#Undue weight|undue weight]].''

You'll note that the point being made is that simply quoting published work is not good enough. Why isn't it good enough? Because unless the work in question has generated discussion it has not been vetted outside of Wikipedia to make it possible to write an article on the subject that adheres to the spirit and letter of NPOV.
--[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 20:36, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
::The POV of a single researcher in a single first-rate peer-reviewed publication, has normally been assessed by 2 or usually 3 independent scientists with a tendency to be ciritical. The assumption made by colleagues it that such results are correct unless proven otherwise. Are we supposed to be more critical of physics that he physicists who review for PRL? Then, if discussed by independent sources, as most scientific papers are, it is considered worth citing and commenting one. Reputable journals expect items listed as references to be relevant to the new work also. I'm a librarian. i think many articles in most library journals are basically trivial if not junk altogether.. But they are considered valuable by my colleagues in general, and its their trms that matter. I will judge by reporting theirs',  not imposing my own.'''[[User:DGG|DGG]]''' 09:02, 9 April 2007 (UTC)

:The statement which I quoted above, is as follows:
::&quot;the point of view of one researcher or research term and, unless it generates a significant outside response by the scientific community or the population at large, fails NPOV&quot;
:A single POV may fail, or being accepted by some other criteria. But a single POV does not fail NPOV (unless an editor writes poorly). 
:*To suggest that a statement based on a single POV, changes it's NPOV standing, depending on some other ''potential'' discussion whose view is yet to be determined, is illogical. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 20:46, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

If your point is that someone can attribute a single point of view in a fashion that is NPOV, that is absolutely correct. However, not every attributable point can be written about in a neutral fashion. An example of a quote that may be non-neutral though properly attributed and sourced is given at [[WP:FRINGE#Sourcing and attribution]]. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 00:01, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

:*Since describing a single POV can be achieved in an NPOV fashion, then the description in the third paragraph is incorrect which says that a single POV without response fails NPOV.
:*Judging/assessing a single POV is another matter altogether. But just because there may be no attributable assessments, does not make the description of a single POV automatically fail NPOV. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 00:34, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

I do not agree with the demand that not only must something be said in a respected peer reviewed journal, but that we must wait for other independent researchers to chime in, in OTHER respected peer reviewed journals, and agree with the first researcher that the claim is valid. The first post would constitute a reliable source satisfying [[WP:ATT]] and would be usable in a Wikipedia article. Similarly a book from a respected publisher would constitute a reliable source, without waiting for some other authority to write another book that says &quot;I agree with the first book.&quot; The demand places the bar way too high. It may be years before someone completely independent of the first researcher publishes the demanded blessing of the first researcher's claim. [[User:Edison|Edison]] 20:20, 9 April 2007 (UTC)

==[[Schmidt Sting Pain Index]]==
Can some of you knowledgable and discerning scientist Wikipedians take a look at this please? This article has currently been getting some coverage in popular &quot;gee whiz funny link of the day... how goofy!&quot; type blogs ( I hate it when this happens and the article in question is dubious... I think it gives a bad impression of wikipedia), but it seems to be mainly based on the idea that this one insect scientist guy wrote some goofy comments for an insect sting pain index one day. Ok, I agree that insect scientists are allowed to have senses of humour (WITHIN LIMITS, for the sake of us all), but I am concerned that 1) this scale is not really widespread and may be just one scale promoted by one guy without much acceptance in the insect expert community. 2) the pdf article linked which this wikipedia entry seems to be based on does not seem to say that Schmidt actually wrote those goofy comments. Its a bit ambiguous, but its seems to say that &quot;the media&quot; (without specifying what media) came up with the goofy comments to append to Schmidt's original dry scale(I think this may be another case where people exaggerate or misinterpret what an article is saying). I dont have any access to science journal databases, and am certainly no science or insect expert. But these concerns and quick scans of google books and google scholar led me to bring this issue to wiser heads. Thanks very much  for checking this out.

The index also has been mentioned in popular science pubs; though it doesn't appear to be taken seriously by scientists.  A scientifically-based pain index would be interesting (though I decline any offers to participate in such research); both this and the related Starr index appear to be little more than the opinions of the bug guys in question.  The article certainly dances on the edge of notability.  --[[User:EngineerScotty|EngineerScotty]] 05:30, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

******Ok, once again, in case anyone can actually respond on my point: the list of criteria here seems to be a misguided attempt to define reasons for notability that no one brings up in debates.  If the issue was the over-''deletion'' of science articles, having these criteria would make sense.  But it seems to me that the main thrust of this proposal is in the opposite direction.  These are just fodder for disagreement (see [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sorce theory]] for instance) and distract from the main point about the POV and OR issues involved in using only sources from a single author.

********Good: a direct response.  Two brief points: (1) Arbcom never asked for criteria, but they did encourage developing a guideline, which is different.  (2) The EU deletion debate looks very different to me - there, the argument was done from first principles and it worked very nicely, and it skirted around the edge of these criteria (no one ever talked about whether the EU concept was &quot;textbook science&quot; or had institutional support)... and as for extended discussions with Iantresman... I don't think the criteria will make one bit of difference, and that's not a very good reason anyway.  Long-winded debate... I don't think we should seek to avoid it as a general principle, debate is a good thing.  Criteria would simplify the job but scientific topics aren't exactly overwhelming the AfD lists.

== General notability guideline template ==
Since the general notability guideline is central to most sub-pages, someone came up with the idea of creating a centralized template which will be consistent among the permutations from WP:N.  Please see whether we can make this work here.  The text is meant to be fairly generic, but it may make sense to add text following the template for fine tuning, or help us to make the template more applicable if it is not reflecting the consensus for notability.  I certainly didn't get everything that I wanted, but I'm very happy to see the compromises that make this a fairly representive of the attitude of the project.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 01:12, 7 April 2007 (UTC)

==Merging [[Wikipedia:Notability (numbers)]]==
What are the thoughts on merging [[Wikipedia:Notability (numbers)]] into this guideline proposal?  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 19:15, 25 April 2007 (UTC)

I've added a brief section which is the meat from the numbers guideline.  This seems appropriately and neatly combined here.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 16:29, 15 May 2007 (UTC)
*It's a bad idea, as explained on the talk page of WP:NUM.

== Scope creep ==

I may be beating a dead horse here, but all the references to NPOV, proponents and advocacy make it seem like this is about pseudoscience/fringe science, and the discussion above seems to confirm it. As it tries to apply to specialised but uncontroversial science, not much of it bears any resemblance to reality. --[[User:Abu-Fool Danyal ibn Amir al-Makhiri|Abu-Fool Danyal ibn Amir al-Makhiri]] 02:29, 6 June 2007 (UTC)

== Proposal concerns (LV) ==
Note that I came here from a couple of AfDs which were trying to present this as policy criteria for an article's deleltion.  As I read down the line, I encountered several problems with the proposed guideline.  I apologize if any and all of the below have been covered in the Talk Archives, which I am not going to read now.

Problems that I have at present with the proposal:

*Introduction:
:* &quot;A topic that is acceptable under this guideline is an appropriate part of Wikipedia.&quot;
::Pretty sweeping blanket statement, to me.  No other Notability criteria I'm aware of suggests that &quot;if it passes this, it's in.&quot;  Indeed, it seems to violate the principle of a Guideline to me, which always limits itself to allow potential exceptions.  Further, each section usually defines which criteria are primary and which are secondary.
*Notability of topics related to science:
:*&quot;Decisions about including or excluding material must always reflect the opinions of outside authorities, not those of Wikipedia editors.&quot;
::I know this has been mentioned above, but I want to echo this concern:  Decisions about including or excluding material must always reflect the consensus of the Wikipedia editors.  Anything else beyond that is helpful clarification, or it becomes fodder for people to [[WP:IAR]].
::I'd feel much more comfortable with something like, ''&quot;Deicions about including or excluding material on a scientific basis ought to be supported by the opinions and stated facts of outside authorities, as per [[WP:RS|Wikpedia:Reliable Sources]].&quot;''  Start throwing 'musts' around in anything but policy (perhaps only unbreakable/unmodifiable policy) and you'll get a lot of irate editors, scientific or not.
:*&quot;Although publication creates verifiability and reputable journals are reliable sources, publication by itself is not a sufficient (and sometimes not necessary) standard for encyclopedic notability. Unpublished research fails no original research and often lacks verifiability, so it is unacceptable by policy. Research published in a reputable publication passes these thresholds but reflects the point of view of one researcher or research term and, unless it generates a significant outside response by the scientific community or the population at large, focusing on such research in a Wikipedia article does not adequately conform to Wikipedia's policy on neutrality, in particular the section on undue weight. This guideline clarifies how the Wikipedia community has applied NPOV to articles on scientific topics. It does however not apply to the inclusion of scientific research as authorative sources within articles. The criterion for such sources is not that they are notable, but that they are reliable.&quot;
::Wha?  Could this be any more complex?  I actually had to diagram this paragraph out to understand it.  My hypothesis is most editors will not.  Can't you simply say it is normally necessary to follow the general notability guidelines with respect to neutral, multiple, independent, verifiabile, reliable sources?  And if you do that, what is the point of this whole section - I'm seriously not understanding how this adds anything to present guidelines.
* Criteria / General
:*&quot;1. Widely cited. Papers covering the topic have been widely1 commented on in academic writing within the topic's field.
::2. Outside notability. The topic is notable due to significant coverage in reliable sources outside of academic publications.&quot;  
::So we want articles only commented upon widely by multiple academic sources, which also are commented on outside academic sources?  Seems pretty wide, to me.
::Aside from that, I know I read somewhere that Wikipedia is not just a general encyclopedia, but can cover articles appropriate to special subject encyclopedias as well.  Thus 2. might well fail, as most specialist encyclopedias I am aware of have many articles which would only be known inside the discipline the encyclopedia represents.
:*&quot;Notable topics which are primarily non-scientific... [etc.]&quot;
::Boy, I'm going to love the AfDs which try to define whether a topic is &quot;science&quot; or not trying to use this.  Not to mention the arguments you'll get whether or not cosmology (for example) has a scientific basis or not.  Not to mention you're setting up a criteria which is so subjective it will rarely-if-ever be able to objectively define where this guideline would be relevant or not.
::Also, you will get editors asking whether the guideline itself applies or not - something I don't think I've ever seen with any of the other specialty N's about the guideline ''itself''.  I don't need to know if Burpa-Cola has been covered in the Cola News and CNN, or if Billy Bob Arthbutnott has both parlimentary opinions as well as the Sun documenting his career to know that Corp or People:Politicians applies.
*Scientific terms
:Again, how does this get beyond neologisms in a way that Avoid Neologisms doesn't, aside from adding the words &quot;scientific literature&quot;?
*Numbers and Sources
:*&quot;1. Have professional mathematicians published papers on this topic?
::2. Is the sequence listed in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences? (In the case of sequences of rational numbers, does the OEIS have the sequences of numerators and denominators of the relevant fractions?)
::3. Do MathWorld and PlanetMath have articles on this topic?&quot;
:::This may be taken from WProj numbers, I don't know.  But are you stipulating that 2 and 3 are reliable sources? (The Sources section has exactly this same problem.  You're controlling what is considered a Reliable Source without allowing the Wikipedia community at large to define that.  I have a problem with that - if I were arguing Notability(Religion), I would not want it to say that the Bible is an authorized source and any other 'holy' texts by default would have to prove themselves.)
*Sources
:*&quot;Scientific discovery is often disconnected from public discourse, so standard methods of sourcing and verifying are not always applicable. A scientific topic which yields low hit counts in the Google test...&quot;
::That's nice.  The Google test is widely regarded as discredited anyway.  Yes, I know it's still used, but it's questionability is known.
::Also, verifying and sourcing is verfying and sourcing.  I believe what's being aimed at here is scientific notability may have a smaller and different base (with different types of sourcing) for inclusion than other forms of notability.  So why not say that?  Except that above you're demanding 'popular' coverage as well as academic.
:*&quot;Web (and library) searches should therefore be evaluated based on the quality rather than the quantity of the finds.&quot;
::Thus, you allow extreme subjectivity creep, unless you are going to make further instruction creep in what constitutes scientific quality.  (My Jung is better than your Freud.  My Hawking beats your Einstein.  My t test is better than your bean counting.)  Common sense might be able to dictate that, but science is full of periods of flying in the face of qualitative common sense and succeeding - because it's right.
:*&quot;The following is a list of sources with qualifications of their usefulness.&quot;
::Again, you're preaching what is and isn't acceptable as a source, without allowing the community consensus to decide this over time. 
:*&quot;Google, Yahoo.... [etc]&quot; 
::Uh, again, how is this any different from Google test?

Finally, may I invite you to consider that most notability guidelines are much less complex and much more tolerant of letting individual cases be decided as individual cases?  And I hope that the question about &quot;Have we reached consensus?&quot; is asking if you as the editors have reached consensus about what you want to present to the community as a whole, as opposed to &quot;Are we ready to make this policy ourselves?&quot;

It may seem like I'm pissing all over your proposal.  I hope it doesn't, because I'd like to see a Notability(Science) guideline.  But I want it to be one that's usable and used - I wouldn't do either with this, and I'd argue as need be when someone tries to use this as a vote justification (which will happen, whether you want it to or not.)  Sorry for the length of the diatribe.

The rejected tag is appropriate and should stand until there is adequate discussion here to demonstrate active interest in the proposal.

It looks like a number of the contributors here are no longer active at WP: Lantreman ws banned, BDJ and Science Appologist have quit, Minder Binder, Abu-Fool Danyal ibn Amir al-Makhiri, and Laughing Vulcan have not contributed substantially since June and at all since mid-July.   &lt;s&gt;Trials and Errors and Radiant are advocating reinstating this as a proposal&lt;/s&gt;, but I don't think that there are enough editors who see this as a need.

* What I see now is something that is so watered down and nebulous that it cannot act as a genuine policy.  If people want to revive this effort, then we need to return to a version like [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Notability_%28science%29&amp;oldid=117329647 this one] and work from there.  IMO, what happenned to this effort is that a number of people whose pet articles were running afoul of this proposed policy chose to get involved with the blatant intent to sabotage it and remove its impact on their work, and unfortunately succeeded in doing so.&lt;br&gt;IMO, there is a genuine need for a policy like this to clarify what &quot;notability&quot; and &quot;verifiability&quot; mean in the context of a science article, and how [[WP:UNDUE]] should be applied.  It may be that this is an issue that is best handled by the admins with the advice and consent of the community so that we can avoid the pitfalls of the past. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:49, 20 August 2007 (UTC)
*I see, if not frequent, so at least [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere/Wikipedia:Notability_%28science%29&amp;limit=500&amp;from=0 recurrent use] of this guideline/proposed guideline/essay, very much in keeping with the rather low number of science-related AfD discussions. Absence of discussion on the talk page certainly doesn't establish rejection. I agree with EMS that the two-item version is watered down beyond recognition of the original version, and I don't see any consensus for it. ~ [[User:Trialsanderrors|trialsanderrors]] 16:07, 20 August 2007 (UTC)
:: Per [[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines]]: ''&quot;A rejected page is any proposal for which consensus support is not present, regardless of whether there is active discussion or not. Consensus need not be fully opposed; if consensus is neutral on the issue and unlikely to improve, the proposal is likewise rejected. It is considered bad form to hide this fact, e.g. by removing the tag. Making small changes will not change this fact, nor will repetitive arguments. Generally it is wiser to rewrite a rejected proposal from scratch and start in a different direction.&quot;'' --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 16:14, 20 August 2007 (UTC)

::: It seems to me that a lot of work has gone into turning this into something that everyone can reject.

== Reverted to earlier version ==

I have reverted the article to the form of lat March, with some twaking of the lead and the first section.  The revised first section now has a simple first paragraph that states the need to this policy as succinctly as I can.  The next two paragraphs have had their order exchanged so that the farily dry &quot;relevance&quot; paragraph comes last.  The previous last paragraph has been removed as an unreadable mess.  (I believe I drafted that paragraph originally, but it really never worked as intended, and only got worse over time.)

The {{tl|rejected}} tag has been kept as a matter of form, with the {{tl|proposed}} tag just commented out but still present.  I for one would be happy to see this version go back to &quot;proposed&quot; status, but I want to see if others are on-board for doing that.  Let's just say that after having taken a rest, I am ready and willing to work towards acceptance of a functional version of this as a policy or guideline if others are. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 18:24, 20 August 2007 (UTC)

:Personally, I don't see a lot of point reviving this.  The criteria have always been an attempt to change practice rather than an attempt to document practice, and to most people, the criteria and the proposal are one and the same.  The criteria really haven't caught on, and from my experience, people rely on other policies for scientific topics, like [[WP:OR]] and [[WP:V]], and where notability is needed, the general [[WP:N]] seems to be sufficient and its use is accepted.

:: Having looked more closely at the edit history, I find that your attempt to streamline this two two items has met fairly stiff resistance.  Then again, that is little wonder since your proposed consolidation ends up being little more than a restatement of pre-existing policy.  The goal of this proposal is to set up guidelines that go beyond the current policies and which are adapted to the issues which are unique to science.  Wikiepdia has very much outgrown [[WP:NOR|&quot;No original research&quot;]] and the requirement to use [[peer review]]ed [[scientific journal|journals]].  What do you do with a source that is &quot;peer reviewed&quot; but where the peers are fellow followers of a [[fringe science|fringe theory]]?  What do you do about the use of [[Nature (journal)|Nature magazine]], which is highly respected but does not use peer review to help select its articles?  What do you make of a theory published in a respected scientific journals but on which noone has cared to comment except the author?  What do you do with the [[cold fusion]] controversy created by Pons and Fleishman back in 1987 which obviously is notable within science but which was never respected by it?  There will not be many of these to contend with, but when they do appear this guideline will be invaluable.
:::::Please excuse my comment here, but the article content of Nature is peer reviewed. Like some other journals, it has on rare occasions published things based on consensus of the key editors, without formal peer review. The news content is not, of course, just editorially prepared -- by the most careful people around. It was they who caught the similarity of the stem cell photos after the peer reviewers missed it.

:: You like to cite [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sorce theory]] as a place where this guideline did not work.  For that I solidly disagree.  That article's creator had to play all kinds of games with these criteria to make a case for keeping the article.  In the end, his attempts to make the article look acceptable only helped to do it in.  In context this is a farly powerful tool.  In addition, it is not going to do in fringe science articles.  For example, I helped by have an aritcle on a book by [[Halton Arp]] kept because it was noted within the field of astronomy and also gained some measure of attention from the public at large.  That press coverage (both scientific and popular) could establish notability as described here was helpful in that discussion. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 01:03, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

:::You might note that my reduction to two criteria stood for over two months without comment.  You may also note that coverage by press and by scientific sources were the criteria I left in place, since those are the only part of the criteria that are useful.  What I object to are the other criteria, like &quot;textbook science&quot; or &quot;popular belief&quot; that are redundant and provide loopholes for argumentative POV pushers.  Can you hypothesize an example where a topic is &quot;textbook science&quot; or has a &quot;prominent advocate&quot; or has &quot;institutional support&quot; where the topic would be acceptable for Wikipedia ''without'' significant coverage in independent, reliable sources, academic or otherwise?

::::I am not sure whether I agree with you or not. I certainly think that there are science articles that are best referenced by standard textbooks, particularly for articles that are at the level of high school or early university science. For example, we probably do not want to source a peer reviewed journal on [[density]] and we do not. Are textbooks reliable sources? If so we do not need to mention &quot;textbook science&quot;, but if they are not, we probable do. --[[User:Bduke|Bduke]] 03:09, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

::::::: As for the other criteria: you agree on 3 and 4.  6 is totally pointless, because none of the criteria would expire once met.  7 obviously must require sourcing to back it up or it's totally vacuous and anyone could claim it about anything.  And anything discussed in a legitimate textbook is already covered in a reliable source, and I highly doubt that we'd ever find a case where one textbook mentions a topic but absolutely no other sources do.  Yeah, I agree, if we pare it any further, the ''criteria'' say nothing more than [[WP:N]] does.. so maybe we should lose the criteria altogether, or just spend more time explaining the issues that arise in assessing the quality of sources, especially academic ones.

(unindent) I think that you have just made an excellent suggestions in calling for an explanation of how to assess the reliability and relevance of sources.  Given some of the issues I have had recently with the anti-relativists over at [[talk:Herbert Dingle]], this makes a lot of sense.  (In those discussions, at least one person would take anything that he could find from a &quot;peer reviewed journal&quot; as evidence of a conflict over relativity and the [[twin paradox]].  Said contributions come from almost unknown overseas journals and in another case a blatantly anti-relativity publisher.)  I would still keep the remaining criteria as a way of saying that those things are the primary hallmarks of scientific notability, while noting that other options for notability are not prohibited. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:20, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

:I believe that's better, but I still think we should remove the criteria.  The problem is, people always seem to conflate a notability guideline and its criteria, while all other text is ignored.  By not having criteria, we would force people to read the discussion about the reliability of scientific sources.  (Actually, come to think about it, &quot;Notability (science)&quot; may not be the best name.  What about &quot;Reliable sources (scientific)&quot;?)

:: The criteria don't exist for the benefit of those that would abuse them but instead for the benefit of those that are looking for good guidance on what is acceptable.  The creator of an article will invariably try to defend it against an AfD.  IMO, if the article's creator can make a case that their article is acceptable under this criteria and everyone agrees, then these criteria have done a service in helping people to make that decision.  Similarly, if people listen to the creator's case and conclude that it does not hold water, then the criteria will also have helped by focussing the debate on the relevant issues and helping to bring about the deletion.  So as I see it these criteria overall are helpful.  Besides, it really is in the absense of clear guidelines that you get the nastiest debates. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 19:01, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

(a) Notability, (b) reliability of a source, and (b) reliable of the facts in that source, are all quite different, and tell us how to describe information, not whether to include it. If Arp publishes some information in an obscure overseas publications, and Stephen Hawkins in in Nature, Arp's supporters will find his article more notable, and no less reliable. And if Hawkins is described in a textbook, then it tells us that his ideas have a wider readership, and neither are as popular as today's astrology column.  &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment was added by [[Special:Contributions/{{{IP|{{{User|84.244.165.174}}}}}}|{{{IP|{{{User|84.244.165.174}}}}}}]] ([[User talk:{{{IP|{{{User|84.244.165.174}}}}}}|talk]]) {{{Time|17:34, August 21, 2007 (UTC)}}}&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Abandon this as an unnecessary complication==

Whether a peer review journal, a textbook, a popular book, a university hosted website or a notable persons personal site  is sufficiently reliable, reputable, or secondary is probably best treated on a case by case basis, and in any case this is not a problem specific to science.

Are there any controversial articles that are better treated by Notability (science) than by WP:NOR, WPV, and WP:N?  I think not.  I think there are too many guidelines, especially where they overlap.  True science should only need to satisfy WP:NOR and WP:V.  Where the subject is not true science, or is borderline, a further test should be simply whether others have written about it.  WP:N provides this test.  A lot of work has been invested in this project page, but that is not sufficient reason to adopt it.  It is rule creep, and it does damage by obfuscating more important policies and guidelines.

There seems to be tendency here for some to want a guideline to provide a science-quality test.  This is not an encyclopaedia’s role.  The ascribing of “Finge science”, “pseudo science” or “lunacy” to any theory is a job for third party sources, not for wikipedia rules.  

EMS suggests that some nasty debates exist because of the weakness of this guideline.  Some elaboration would be nice.  Discussion above suggests to me that the relativity article needs work, not that wikipedia needs more rules.

This project page should be abandoned.  Science is well covered by WP:OR and WP:V, and where notability is needed, the general WP:N seems to be sufficient and its use is accepted. --[[User:SmokeyJoe|SmokeyJoe]] 02:08, 22 August 2007 (UTC)

It’s always about sourcing, specifically whether the sources are sufficiently independent, sufficiently secondary, sufficiently reputable (not a blog or similar), or covers the subject in sufficient depth.  These are all straight WP:N issues, deriving directly from a combination of WP:NOR and WP:V.  There is plenty of evidence of spirited debate in places about the science of the content involved, and this sometimes is uncivil, but such spirited debate seems to me to be irrelevant to the debates, and always a symptom of editors who are too far into OR editing and are not looking at the subject objectively.  This is why Notability (science) may do more harm than good.  It suggests that there is something special about science.  The criteria for inclusion in wikipedia do not depend upon the science.

==physics? i think not==
do not confuse the observer effect with the uncertainty principle. the uncertainty principle has nothing to do with &quot;observing&quot;, it has to do with measuring. the observer effect is a supposed effect of observing an event and the influence of your presence on the event. no one would ever have to actually observe a particle's position to obfuscate its momentum, the mere act of using the photons to measure its position, even if nobody ever observed it, would suffice.

-------------
don't you have to observe in order to measure?
-------------

Indeed.  But what does measuring have to do with Quantum Mechanics exactly?  

To measure is to observe the results of a measurement process [that ascertains the subject measurement].  Humans observe with their senses — the senses that humans have.  Other conscious beings, perhaps including computers, may have other senses with which they can implement tools for making measurements.  At the end of the day, measuring ''ALWAYS'' involves observing.  

Tools used by beings to make measurements are limited (in their accuracy) by various factors including the limitations of ones senses.  The often-mentioned example of bouncing a photon off of an atom to measure its position illustrates the problem with knowing the position ''AND'' momentum of ''THAT'' atom at the ''SAME MOMENT'' in time.  The concept usually centers on the fact that the position measurement photon will change the momentum of the subject atom.  But aren't there other aspects of this problem?  

In the limit (considering the non-zero mass of the atom and the non-zero energy of the photon), can one ever know perfectly even the position alone?  Perhaps so, since the mechanical inertance of the atom precludes its reaction at ''THAT'' infinitesimal instant in time.  

Why is not ''THIS'' example an instance of &quot;observer effect&quot; rather than the uncertainty principle, per se?  If one seeks only to measure the position alone, then maybe it is neither.  Then again, is it not &quot;Observer Effect&quot; even if the momentum is changed by measuring only the position?  One would think so.  

Well, what if we start with measuring the momentum &quot;first&quot;?  How does one measure momentum, anyway?  Again, we observers devise a measurement process that allows our senses to detect the &quot;answer.&quot;  Momentum is mass times velocity.  If we know the mass, we might then seek to measure the velocity.  Human observers tend to ascertain velocity by measuring position at two points in time.  For non-zero velocities, this means two different points in space, of course.  Yet, [instantaneous] velocity is ''DEFINED'' at only one point in space and time.  Thus, one cannot measure velocity (or momentum) in this manner: one must ''WAIT'' to ''SEE'' how fast it is moving, and this yields only an average (not instantaneous) value.  

Before continuing on to propose measuring momentum, per se, by some other means (say, smashing the atom into an obstacle at a known position), we should note that the Uncertainty Principle pertains only to Quantum Mechanics.  In ''THAT'' world, particles are not particles; rather, they are probability density functions.  The interpretation of this ''MODEL'' of a particle says the position and momentum of the subject particle are INHERENTLY uncertain by virtue of the mathematical model itself.  To precisely derive the position, one must manipulate the model in a manner that causes the momentum &quot;to drop out of the formula,&quot; and vice versa.  

The relationship between position and momentum described by Quantum Mechanics is somewhat like the relationship between the time domain and the frequency domain described by the Fourier Transform.  One can say that there is some similarity as well between position and velocity in Classical Mechanics.  In fact, the description above with knowing the velocity versus position of the atom is exactly that: Classical Mechanics. 

Following this line of thinking, one (''such as this user who is not fluent in the intricate semantics of Quantum Theory'') might be likely to reach these conclusions: 
 

'''1. Using &quot;particulate&quot; atoms and photons to describe the Uncertainty Principle of Quantum Mechanics is ''flat wrong''.''' 

'''2. One does not observe Quantum Mechanics.  Rather, one uses that theory to make calculations to explain the observations of certain experiments.'''

'''3. Measurements ''ALWAYS'' involve observations and therefore also ''ALWAYS'' involve the Observer Effect.  Perhaps this ''IS'' the “Theory of the Observer Effect.”'''

'''4. The Uncertainty Principle of Quantum Mechanics and the Observer Effect are ''fundamentally'' unrelated.'''  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:JimRodgers|JimRodgers]] ([[User talk:JimRodgers|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/JimRodgers|contribs]]) 12:54, 31 July 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

For some reason this article is more focused on what the observer effect is not. --[[User:Nathanael Bar-Aur L.|Nathanael Bar-Aur L.]] 20:09, 10 April 2007 (UTC)

From what I understood from other sources, the observer effect is basically the collapsing of a quantum system's wavefunction that happens the moment a measurement in made upon it (by an &quot;observer&quot;), therefore cancelling any superposition that may have existed beforehand, and giving specific definition to the renderings. Is this correct? --[[User:Nathanael Bar-Aur L.|Nathanael Bar-Aur L.]] 20:21, 10 April 2007 (UTC)

==Suggestions==
Current article states &quot;not that of the driveshaft, along the axis of the car&quot;.
Add a paragraph that illustrates this with the driveshaft of the front-engine, rear-wheel-drive Porsche 928.
Also industrial examples and diagrams from mechanical engineering and classical mechanics.
e.g. a torque tube to allign parts of a hinge operated by two hydraulic cylinders.&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/206.188.57.60|206.188.57.60]] ([[User talk:206.188.57.60|talk]]) 14:42, 30 October 2006 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;

== Diagrams ==
Can anyone find a picture of this? I'm having a very hard time picturing what this would look like...[[User:70.157.134.125|70.157.134.125]] 01:01, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

==Accuracy==
This page is not really accurate. Cars like the STS, Corvette, etc. have independent rear suspensions, and the torque tube is not used to transmit acceleration forces in these vehicles. Rather, it is because they have trans-axles in the rear of the car and it connects the trans-axle with the engine in the front. However, I am not enough of an expert on the subject to write a clear and well-written clarification so I have just added some templates to the top of the page. --[[User:Ozziegt|Ozziegt]] ([[User talk:Ozziegt|talk]]) 21:33, 1 July 2009 (UTC)

:Corvette since at least 1988 doesn't have a torque tube (unless they put one in later), and apart from the Miata I'm hard pushed to think of an IRS that uses one. I agree, this article is pretty horrid, it needs a rewrite rather than refs. [[User:Greglocock|Greglocock]] ([[User talk:Greglocock|talk]]) 11:13, 2 July 2009 (UTC)

:Corvettes since the late 90's do indeed have torque tubes, of the same type that the Porsche 924/944/928 etc use.  All the mentioned Porsches are IRS and use a torque tube.  Part of the probem with this article is that it lumps very diverse systems together;  the early Ford systems are completely different from the Corvette/Porsche systems.  Both are classified as torque tubes, but the article does not focus on the essence of a TT, which is the use of a smaller torque-transmitting element inside a carrier. The carrier may or may not be static and may or may not be carrying driveline forces (like the Fords). [[User:52FordF-1|52FordF-1]] ([[User talk:52FordF-1|talk]]) 15:44, 18 July 2009 (UTC)

::Yup my bad, 2005 Corvette (as a random example) uses a transaxle and a torque tube. Note that the Corvette system is different to the Peugoet one, as the latter includes an articulating joint at the front whereas the Corvette system does not. This is a big deal, to a driveline engineer at least.[[User:Greglocock|Greglocock]] ([[User talk:Greglocock|talk]]) 23:25, 18 July 2009 (UTC)

:Agreed. The article as written is essentially BS. A torque tube fundamentally counteracts the torque of the driveshaft; the alternative is that the torque is counteracted by the torsional rigidity of the frame (the net torque must, obviously, be zero otherwise the rear of the car would rotate). The torque tube often does transfer forward wheel force to the front of the car, but this is not inherent in the mere fact of having a torque tube: there must still be a mechanism locating the wheels longitudinally relative to the diff/transaxle. This is analogous to the usual need to locate the wheels relative to the frame (most simply, with leaf springs) in order to move the car forward.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/110.175.57.184|110.175.57.184]] ([[User talk:110.175.57.184|talk]]) 05:05, 18 March 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== simple definition? ==

It has been my understanding from looking through service manuals and talking to mechanics that the corvette style torque tubes are just an enclosed driveshaft that connects a front mounted engine to the rear mounted transmission (with fully independent rear suspension)

I guess it's not simply called a 'driveshaft' in a classical sense since it doesn't connect a front mounted transmission to the rear differential  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/184.57.87.173|184.57.87.173]] ([[User talk:184.57.87.173|talk]]) 20:38, 15 August 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</text>

'''''Hello!'''''

Thanks for uploading some pictures to Wikipedia.  I wanted to make sure you were aware of some of the requirements and good practices for uploaded images.

*'''Pick an image name.'''
:When [[Special:Upload|uploading]] an image, pick a file name that is descriptive, and unique.  Remember that many images may be uploaded about the same topic, and remember that names are case sensitive.

*'''Source the image.'''
:On the [[Help:Image page|image description page]], explain where the image came from.  If you created the image yourself, then say so.  If it's from the web, give a URL.  If it's a screenshot of a movie or game, or a scan from a book, give the title.

*'''Provide copyright and license information.'''
:This part is a little bit trickier, but it's very important.  The copyright of the image generally belongs to whomever created it.
::''If it's a photograph you took, or an image you created'' (modifying an image that already exists doesn't count) in software like [[Photoshop]] or [[GIMP]], then you own the copyright.  To upload it to Wikipedia, you must agree to license it under the [[GFDL]] (which allows anyone to use it, but requires that they give credit to the original author and requires that any further edit to the image be licensed under the GFDL as well) or release it into the [[public domain]] (which allows anyone to use it for any purpose without restriction.)  Do this by placing an appropriate [[WP:ICT|tag]] on the [[Wikipedia:image description page|image description page]], like &amp;#123;{[[Template:GFDL|GFDL]]}} or &amp;#123;{[[Template:PD|PD]]}}.  Be sure to mention that you created the image.  If you're using &amp;#123;{[[Template:PD|PD]]}}, you may also want to use &amp;#123;{[[Template:NoRightsReserved|NoRightsReserved]]}}, since there is some dispute as to whether one may grant items into the public domain.
::''If you didn't create the image,'' or the copyright somehow belongs to another party (like a screenshot, which you might &quot;create&quot;, but the copyright belongs to the author of the movie or video game), then you need to find another [[WP:ICT|tag]] that describes the copyright status of the image.  Images used on Wikipedia need to be free for our use and the use of [[WP:FORKS|sites]] which reproduce our content.  This means that images cannot have a restriction such as &quot;only for use by Wikipedia&quot;, or &quot;for non-commercial use only&quot;, or &quot;for educational use&quot;.  Images without a free license may be usable in certain articles under [[WP:FU|fair use]], but such a use should be justified on the image description page.

*'''Describe the image.'''
:To another reader, the image may not be immediately understood.  A caption in an article doesn't explain the image to a visitor who sees it on its image page.  Put a brief explanation of what is in the image on the image description page, similar to what you might include in a caption on an article.  

Some links to Wikipedia pages on this subject: 

'''[[Wikipedia:Copyrights#Image guidelines|Copyrights]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags|Copyright tags]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Fair use|Fair use]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Image description page|Image description page]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Granting work into the public domain|Public domain]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion|Images for deletion]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Possibly unfree images|Possibly unfree images]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Copyright problems|Copyright problems]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Uploading images|Uploading images]]'''

Thanks again for your contributions.  If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me at my talk page. [[User:Feydey|feydey]] 19:42, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

An '''anti-submarine missile'''  is a [[standoff missile|standoff]] [[anti-submarine weapon]]. Often a variant of [[anti-ship missile]] designs an anti-submarine systems typically use a [[jet engine|jet]] or [[rocket engine|rocket]] engine, to deliver: an [[explosive material|explosive]] [[warhead]] aimed directly at a [[submarine]]; a [[depth charge]], or;  a homing [[torpedo]] that is carried from a launch ship, or other  platform, to the vicinity of a target.
[[File:Ikara missile.JPG|thumb|right|&lt;small&gt;[[Ikara (missile)|Ikara]], an [[Australia]]n-designed missile used by several navies between the 1960s and 1990s; a [[rocket engine|rocket]]-parachute delivery system carried an [[acoustic torpedo]] up to 10 nautical miles (19 km) after launch. A variant re-designed in the UK and used by the Royal Navy could deliver a [[Nuclear depth bomb|nuclear depth charge]].&lt;/small&gt;]]
[[File:Maille-Braize-14.jpg|thumb|&lt;small&gt;The [[Malafon]], used by the French Navy between 1966 and 1997, used a rocket-assisted glider to carry a torpedo up to 8 nautical miles (13 km) after launch&lt;/small&gt;. ]]

==History==
[[Depth charge]]s were the earliest weapons designed for use by ships against submerged [[submarine]]s. These explosives were initially dropped as the ship moved over the presumed location of a submarine. Before World War II, shipboard [[sonar]] was unable to maintain contact with a submarine at close range. 

Various [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]]-type projectors, including [[hedgehog (weapon)|hedgehog]] and [[squid (weapon)|squid]], were devised during [[World War II]] to allow a ship to maintain sonar contact while lobbing explosive charges toward the submarine.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Terry, and Costello, John ''The Battle of the Atlantic'' (1977) Dial Press {{Listed Invalid ISBN|0-8037-6454-2}} pp.307-308&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the [[Cold War]], [[missile]]s were developed to provide greater range with reduced [[recoil]]. Some missiles and rockets carry [[homing torpedo]]es to provide terminal guidance for the warhead.&lt;ref&gt;Albrecht, Gerhard ''Weyer's Warships of the World'' (1969) United States Naval Institute p.385&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''northern river shark''' or '''New Guinea river shark''' (''Glyphis garricki'') is a [[species]] of [[requiem shark]], in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Requiem shark|Carcharhinidae]] found in scattered [[tidal river]]s and associated coastal waters in northern [[Australia]] and in [[Papua New Guinea]]. This species inhabits areas with poor visibility, soft bottoms, and large [[tide]]s, with immature sharks ranging into [[freshwater|fresh]] and [[brackish water]]. It is similar to other river sharks in having a stocky grey body with a high back, tiny eyes, and broad fins. It measures up to {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} long.

Northern river sharks are likely [[piscivorous]]. This species is [[viviparous]], with females bearing litters of 9 young possibly every other year before the [[wet season]]. Very rare and facing threats from [[commercial fishing|commercial]] and [[recreational fishing]], and perhaps also [[habitat degradation]], this species has been assessed as [[Critically Endangered]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]].

==Taxonomy==
The first known specimens of the northern river shark, two newborn males from Papua New Guinea, were discovered by [[New Zealand]] [[ichthyologist]] [[Jack Garrick]], after whom the species was eventually  named. This shark was referred to as &quot;''Glyphis'' sp. C&quot; until 2008, when it was formally described by [[Leonard Compagno]], William White, and [[Peter R. Last]] in a [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] paper. The [[type specimen]] is a female {{convert|67|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, collected from the [[East Alligator River]], [[Kakadu National Park]], [[Northern Territory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Compagno, L.J.V. |author2=W.T.

==Distribution and habitat==
The northern river shark has been reported from [[King Sound]], the [[Ord River]], and Doctors Creek near [[Derby, Western Australia]], the [[Adelaide River|Adelaide]] and [[Alligator Rivers]] in Australia's [[Northern Territory]], and the [[Daru]] region and possibly the [[Fly River]] in Papua New Guinea. It inhabits large [[river]]s, [[estuaries]], and coastal [[bay]]s, all of which are characterized by high [[turbidity]], silty or muddy bottoms, and large tides. Young and juvenile sharks are found in fresh, brackish, and salt water ([[salinity]] ranging from 2 to 36 ppt), whereas adults have only been found in marine environments.&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pillans et al&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pillans, R.D. |author2=J.D.

==Description==
Like other members of its genus, the northern river shark has a stocky body with a high back. The head is wide and flattened, with a broadly rounded snout and minute eyes equipped with [[nictitating membrane]]s. Each [[nostril]] is divided into a very large incurrent opening and a small excurrent opening by a triangular skin flap. The sizable mouth is broadly arched, with short furrows at the corners. Thirty-one to 34 tooth rows are in the upper jaw and 30&amp;ndash;35 tooth rows are in the lower jaw; the upper teeth are upright and triangular with serrated edges, while the lower teeth are narrower and straight to slightly curved. In the largest individuals, the first few lower teeth from the jaw median are spear-shaped with serrations near the tip.&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;/&gt;

The [[pectoral fin]]s are large and broad, with gently backward-curving margins and pointed tips. The [[pelvic fin]]s are triangular with nearly straight trailing margins. The first [[dorsal fin]] is long-based and triangular, with the apex almost forming a right angle; the second dorsal fin is some two-thirds as high as the first. The origin of the first dorsal fin lies over the pectoral fin insertions, while that of second dorsal fin lies over the pelvic fin rear tips. No ridge exists between the dorsal fins. The [[anal fin]] is smaller than the second dorsal fin and has a strong notch in the rear margin. The [[caudal fin]] has a strong lower lobe and a long, narrow upper lobe with a ventral notch near the tip. The [[dermal denticle]]s are small, oval, and overlapping, bearing three horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth. This shark is steel-gray above and white below; the color transition is sharp, located well below the eye, and becomes jagged on the sides of the trunk. The anal and caudal fins become dusky or black towards the trailing margins and tips. The maximum known length is {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}}. This species differs from the [[speartooth shark]] (''G. glyphis'') in several [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] and [[meristic]] characters, including having fewer [[vertebra]]e (137&amp;ndash;151 versus 213&amp;ndash;222) and a lower, jagged gray-white color boundary.&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;/&gt;

==Biology and ecology==
With its slender teeth, small eyes, and high density of [[ampullae of Lorenzini]], the northern river shark seems to be [[adaptation|adapted]] for hunting [[fish]] in conditions of poor visibility. In Doctors Creek, sharks may move to and from favored feeding areas with the tide.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thorburn, D.C., D.L. Morgan, A.J. Rowland and H.S. Gill. (February 2004). [http://www.environment.gov.au/coasts/publications/pubs/glyphis-wa.pdf The northern river shark (''Glyphis'' sp. C) in Western Australia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108234623/http://environment.gov.au/coasts/publications/pubs/glyphis-wa.pdf |date=8 November 2011 }}. Report to the National Heritage Trust, Murdoch University. Retrieved on 10 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Like other requiem sharks, this species is [[viviparous]], with the developing [[embryo]]s forming a [[placenta]]l connection to their mother after exhausting their supply of [[yolk]]. Females give birth around October, before the start of the [[wet season]], on possibly a biennial cycle. One female examined contained nine [[fetus]]es.&lt;ref name=&quot;pillans et al&quot;/&gt; The young are born at under {{convert|67|cm|in|abbr=on}} long; males [[sexual maturity|mature]] between lengths of {{convert|1.2|and|1.4|m|ft|abbr=on}}, while females mature between lengths of {{convert|1.4|and|1.7|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;/&gt;

==Human interactions==
The northern river shark appears to be extremely rare, though more subpopulations may remain to be discovered in Australia and Papua New Guinea. Based on present information, no more than 250 mature individuals are estimated to exist in the wild, with no more than 50 in any particular subpopulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt; This species is caught legally and illegally by [[commercial fisheries]] using [[longline fishing|longlines]] and [[gillnet]]s, as well as by [[recreational fishing|recreational fishers]]; [[habitat degradation]] may pose a further threat to its survival. Because of its low natural abundance, limited distribution, stringent habitat requirements, and susceptibility to various human-caused threats, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] has assessed the northern river shark as [[critically endangered]]. It has also been listed as endangered on the 1999 Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, and on the 2000 Territory Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act. Kakadu National Park may be an important protected area for this species.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt; No regulations restrict the capture of this species in Papua New Guinea.&lt;ref name=&quot;white et al&quot;/&gt;

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Zoidberg. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Zoidberg~enwiki that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]]. If you think you might own all of the accounts with this name and this message is in error, please visit [[Special:MergeAccount]] to check and attach all of your accounts to prevent them from being renamed.

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== Hare Krishna picture ==

There is a picture of a Hare Krishna procession in the [[Religion_in_Mexico#Buddhism|Buddhism]] section, even with a caption about them being buddhists. Hare Krishnas are not buddhists, they are hindus. The article is semi-protected so I can not correct that myself. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Wenzelkarbovski|Wenzelkarbovski]] ([[User talk:Wenzelkarbovski|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Wenzelkarbovski|contribs]]) 17:39, 22 April 2015 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Self-ascription fallacy ==

''The last census reported, by self-ascription, that over 95% of the population is Christian.''

The so-called self-ascription of the census is nothing but a silly way of measuring data. Obviously they count children as Christians just because their parents say so. This people should either be clear about this or not count children at all. By the way, since a couple of years ago the Catholic Church has started to indoctrinate [[Huichol]] kids. Shame on us, Mexicans. Shame on us... The Huichols were one of the very few indigenous people whose religious tradition haven't been polluted by Catholicism but now the church has started taking advantage of the poverty of this people and the new constitutional reforms to infiltrate to their villages and improvise &quot;schools&quot;. Of course they know that adults wouldn't let themselves be indoctrinated so they choose to attack young minds. Catholicism and ignorance have been the ingredients of our condition as a Third World country.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Scandza|Scandza]] ([[User talk:Scandza|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Scandza|contribs]]) 13:27, 30 May 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;


Can anyone explain why the Evangelical Free Church of America does so many, many missionary trips to Mexico, when it's a predominantly catholic country? I mean, there are definite ideological differences involved, but I wasn't aware the two churches actively tried to convert each other's members.


==First phrase==

Any interest in removing &quot;Unlike some other Latin American countries&quot; from the first sentence of the article? It does not seem to serve any objective purpose and seems slightly antagonistic.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Namenderkrieg|Namenderkrieg]] ([[User talk:Namenderkrieg|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Namenderkrieg|contribs]]) 15:34, 24 March 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Easter==

I'm removing this:

&quot;Some of them however, do not celebrate Easter because they think that the Easter Bunny is the devil. Instead of celebrating Easter, they like to eat Mexican Pizzas.&quot;

because it's obviously untrue and just stupid. I think the article should be rewritten though, by someone more experienced than I am.--[[User:PARCGOP|PARCGOP]] 14:09, 7 April 2007 (UTC)

==Contradiction?==
This article says that 95% of people in Mexico are Roman Catholic.  The Mexico article states that 95% of people are Christian, and only 89% are Roman Catholic.  Which is correct, or am I just confused?
[[User:Yumecosmos|Yumecosmos]] ([[User talk:Yumecosmos|talk]]) 02:20, 9 January 2008 (UTC)

== Rewriting ==

I have imported the Religion section from the article on [[Mexico]] and integrated the information that was only on this article. I also moved around paragraphs and added a subtitle to make reading easier. Finally I removed the stub templates and replaced it with the expand one. --[[User:Marianika|Marianika]] ([[User talk:Marianika|talk]]) 16:32, 19 May 2008 (UTC)

== What about non-believers? ==

What about atheists, agnostics, deists in Mexico? How many Mexicans actually believe in God? Is there any data about that?  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/213.196.243.113|213.196.243.113]] ([[User talk:213.196.243.113|talk]]) 22:41, 27 May 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Mexican Ethnic Religion (Mexicayotl) ==

This article lacks a part about the growing movement of Mexicayotl, or Ethnic Mexican Culture or Religion, which is the revival of &quot;Aztec&quot; religion. --[[Special:Contributions/79.45.49.143|79.45.49.143]] ([[User talk:79.45.49.143|talk]]) 12:47, 16 August 2010 (UTC)

== Typo in Nonreligious section ==

'''John Ralph Ragazzini''' (January 3, 1912&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pnxBAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=John+Ralph+Ragazzini+1912&amp;dq=John+Ralph+Ragazzini+1912&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjC4sew9dPVAhXMHJoKHeWmAFsQ6AEIKzAB Profile of John Ralph Ragazzini]&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; November 22, 1988) was an [[United States|American]] [[electrical engineer]] and a professor of [[Electrical Engineering]]. 

==Biography==
Ragazzini was born in [[Manhattan, New York City]] and received the degrees of B.S. and E.E. at the [[City College of New York]] in 1932 and 1933 and earned the degrees of A.M. and Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at [[Columbia University]] in 1939 and 1941.

Ragazzini was dean of the School of Engineering and Science at [[New York University]] and during [[World War II]] he was chairman of the Department of Electrical Engineering at Columbia University, where he was involved in the [[Manhattan Project]].

Ragazzini's notable students are [[Rudolf E. Kálmán]] (see [[Kalman filter]]s), [[Eliahu Ibraham Jury]] (see [[Z-transform]]), [[Gene F. Franklin]] (see [[digital control]]), and [[Lotfi Asker Zadeh]] (see [[Fuzzy sets]] and [[Fuzzy logic]]).

Ragazzini is also credited, along with Lotfi Zadeh, in 1952, to have pioneered the development of the [[z-transform]] method in [[discrete-time]] [[signal processing]] and analysis.

In 1970 he received the [[Rufus Oldenburger Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asme.org/about-asme/honors-awards/achievement-awards/rufus-oldenburger-medal |title=Rufus Oldenburger Medal |publisher=[[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] |accessdate={{Format date|2013|2|14}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, [[American Automatic Control Council]] named [[John R. Ragazzini Award]] after Ragazzini and he was the first recipient of the award. Ragazzini died on 22 November 1988, aged 76.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/24/obituaries/john-ragazzini-76-educator-and-engineer.html&lt;/ref&gt;

I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under [[Wikipedia:Fair use|fair use]] but there is no [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline|explanation or rationale]] as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags/Fair use|boilerplate fair use template]], you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with [[WP:FU|fair use]].

Please go to [[:Image:Brokeninpieces.jpg|the image description page]] and edit it to include a [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline |fair use rationale]]. Using one of the templates at [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline]] is an easy way to insure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template. Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.

If there is other other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on the other images used on this page.

The '''United Church, Chapel on the Hill''' in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]] was the city's main church during [[World War II]]. Dedicated on September 30, 1943 and completed late in October 1943, it was originally a multi-denominational [[chapel]] shared by [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and [[Judaism|Jewish]] congregations.&lt;ref name=NationalRegister/&gt;&lt;ref name=churchhistory&gt;[http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=category&amp;sectionid=4&amp;id=39&amp;Itemid=55 Church History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728092956/http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=category&amp;sectionid=4&amp;id=39&amp;Itemid=55 |date=July 28, 2011 }}, United Church, Chapel on the Hill website, accessed March 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architectural design ==
The building design is a [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] 700-series [[U.S. Army]] chapel.&lt;ref name=Townsite&gt;[http://oakridgevisitor.com/history/pdf/OriginalTownSites.pdf Chapel on the Hill] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517124718/http://oakridgevisitor.com/history/pdf/OriginalTownSites.pdf |date=May 17, 2008 }} in ''Jackson Square – the original Townsite'', Oak Ridge Convention and Visitors' Bureau&lt;/ref&gt; It is a frame building built on a three-bay rectangular plan with a [[Steeple (architecture)|steeple]]d [[bell tower]] and a [[gable]] entry [[porch]]. It was one of three Army chapels built using the same design in Oak Ridge during World War II. One of the other two chapels, the West Chapel in the city's West Village area, was later torn down, but the East Chapel in the East Village is still in use.&lt;ref name=NationalRegister&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfo.doe.gov/me70/history/NPSweb/Oak_Ridge_Historic_District_(Preferred).pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form for Oak Ridge Historic District |date=July 18, 1991 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829041710/http://www.cfo.doe.gov/me70/history/NPSweb/Oak_Ridge_Historic_District_%28Preferred%29.pdf |archivedate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The U.S. Army built the chapel to house religious activities, as one of numerous community facilities in the &quot;townsite&quot; area of Oak Ridge. The building was dedicated on September 30, 1943, in a ceremony that included [[prayer]]s and talks by a Jewish [[rabbi]], a [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|Catholic priest]], an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] priest, a [[Baptist]] minister, and the [[minister (Christianity)|minister]] who was serving the United Church congregation that eventually came to own the chapel.&lt;ref&gt;Charles W. Johnson and Charles O. Jackson (1981), ''City Behind a Fence: Oak Ridge, Tennessee, 1942-1946''. The University of Tennessee Press. Pages 127-129.&lt;/ref&gt; Its name, &quot;The Chapel on the Hill,&quot; comes from a reference in a prayer by the Knoxville Baptist minister who participated in the dedication.&lt;ref name=Townsite/&gt;

The United Church congregation that is housed in the Chapel on the Hill traces its history to July 18, 1943, when some 25 to 30 Christians of diverse denominational backgrounds gathered for Sunday worship in Oak Ridge's main [[cafeteria]]. Subsequently, several members of the group made plans to establish an interdenominational Protestant church, led by [[laity|layperson]]s, to include all denominations. A [[Presbyterian]] minister working in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] was engaged to conduct weekly services, and about 150 people representing 13 Protestant denominations became charter members of &quot;the United Church&quot;. Governing boards of laypersons elected to lead the new congregation took up their duties on October 24, 1943.&lt;ref name=pre1980&gt;[http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=51&amp;Itemid=55 Pre-1980 Historical Compilation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728093006/http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=51&amp;Itemid=55 |date=July 28, 2011 }}, United Church, Chapel on the Hill website, accessed March 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Chapel-on-the-Hill was completed that same month, the United Church and the local Roman Catholic Church were given control of the building, as the only two churches then officially operating in the [[Manhattan Project]] community. During the war, when Oak Ridge's Manhattan Project facilities were operating around the clock, the chapel building was also in use nearly 24 hours a day as a venue for worship services, [[wedding]]s, and other occasions for local workers of various Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish religious backgrounds.&lt;ref name=pre1980/&gt;

At the peak of wartime activity in Oak Ridge, when the population exceeded 70,000, the United Church employed four ministers and conducted worship services in the Chapel on the Hill, East Village Chapel, and the Jefferson Theater, as well as [[Sunday school]] classes in several local schools and a [[mobile home|trailer]] camp. By 1951, the United Church Chapel-on-the-Hill consolidated as a single [[interdenominational]] congregation, making its home in the Chapel on the Hill building.&lt;ref name=pre1980/&gt;

The United Church congregation purchased the chapel and {{convert|3.72|acre|ha}} of land from the [[U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]] on May 11, 1955 for a price of $17,116.&lt;ref name=pre1980/&gt; An adjoining educational building was added in 1956-1957.

It is felt that the article you created at [[Ethan cavett]] is not suitable for a Wikipedia article, which must have a [[Wikipedia:Notability|notable]] subject and be [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verifiable]]. I have moved it to [[User:{{PAGENAME}}]], which is where users are free to write about themselves. You are at liberty to move it back into the (Main) namespace but bear in mind that if you do so, it is likely to be nominated for deletion. 

Note, however, that the purpose of a user page is to enable active editors of Wikipedia to introduce themselves to other editors. [[WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_a_blog.2C_webspace_provider.2C_or_social_networking_site|Wikipedia is not a general hosting service]], so your user page is not a personal homepage. Content unrelated to Wikipedia or its editing is likely to be removed.

Please see [[WP:User_page|the user page guidelines]], especially [[WP:User_page#What_can_I_not_have_on_my_user_page.3F|this section]] for more information. -- [[User:Omicronpersei8|Omicronpersei8]] ([[User talk:Omicronpersei8|talk]]) 19:36, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

'''Archer''' is a [[slab serif]] typeface designed in 2001 by [[Tobias Frere-Jones]] and [[Jonathan Hoefler]] for use in ''[[Martha Stewart Living]]'' magazine. It was later released by [[Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones]] for commercial licensing.

==Structure==

The typeface is a [[Slab_serif#Geometric_model|geometric]] slab serif, one with a geometric design similar to sans-serif fonts. It takes inspiration from mid-twentieth century designs such as [[Rockwell (typeface)|Rockwell]].

The face is unique for combining the geometric structure of twentieth-century European slab-serifs but imbuing the face with a domestic, less strident tone of voice. [[Ball terminal|Balls]] were added to the upper terminals on letters such as ''C'' and ''G'' to increase its charm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Devroye|first1=Luc|title=Jonathan Hoefler|url=http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-27370.html|publisher=McGill University|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Italic type|Italics]] are true italic designs, with flourishes influenced by calligraphy, an unusual feature for geometric slab serif designs. As with many [[Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones]] designs, it was released in a wide range of weights from hairline to bold, reflecting its design goal as a typeface for complex magazines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Typographica review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Earls|first1=David John|title=Archer|url=http://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/archer/|website=Typographica|accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
The typeface has been used for, among other things, branding for [[Wells Fargo]] and is a main font for the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' and [[Wes Anderson]]'s film ''[[The Grand Budapest Hotel]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=Lauren|title=Is Archer's Use on Target?|url=http://www.aiga.org/is-archers-use-on-target/|publisher=AIGI}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the current font used for titles and body text by the [[Design Observer]] website.

===[[Katisha]]===
Contains no information not in [[The Mikado]] article, the point of the spin-off unclear, as the character only appears in one opera, and it's unclear how this could expand further. In normal circumstances I'd say merge or make it a redirect, but, as I said, everything IS covered in [[The Mikado]], and I can't imagine someone searching for &quot;Katisha&quot;.

*'''Delete''' article per nomination.  Anything notable about this character should appear in the plot summary of ''[[The Mikado]]''.  There is no reason to have a separate article for this character.  -- [[User:Ssilvers|Ssilvers]] 19:59, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Redirect''' it to [[The Mikado]] -- merge isn't needed since the info's there, but the redirect could be useful -- somebody could search for it. -- [[User:ArglebargleIV|ArglebargleIV]] 22:15, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

A tag has been placed on [[:Nonamaker]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article seems to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable [[Wikipedia:Notability|(see the guidelines for notability here)]]. If you can indicate why the subject of this article is notable, you may contest the tagging. To do this, please affix the template &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; to the page and leave a note on [[Talk:Nonamaker|the article's talk page]] explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself.

Please read the [[WP:CSD|criteria for speedy deletion]] (specifically, article #7) and [[Wikipedia:Notability (people)|our general biography criteria]].

== Waterboarding ==

Could you post a link where somebody calls [[surfing]] [[waterboarding]]?  I can't seem to find any. [[User:Jehochman|Jehochman]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Jehochman|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:46, 26 April 2009 (UTC)

Yes, Waterboarding is a very common term in Hawaii, the Western US, Australia and even some former Soviet countries. Here's a link to an article where the author references this http://mydailyclarity.com/2009/03/surfing-for-peace-in-the-gaza/. Also, I found a site that references waterboarding here http://www.hawaiiansouthshore.com/shop/product.php?productid=17375. It get's confusing; I was looking for 'surfing' but we call it Waterboarding so I got to the wrong page ;-)

: Fair enough.  That source uses &quot;water boarding&quot; with a space.  I've made a change to your edit to reflect the space. [[User:Jehochman|Jehochman]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Jehochman|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:23, 26 April 2009 (UTC)</text>

I removed &quot;2006 is only his second full season as a team-manager. It took other team managers, such as [[Frank Williams]] many years to win a grand prix as manager.&quot;

This suggests Fry is responsible for a dramatic turnaround in the team's performance - their 2005 and 2006 performances have been widely acknowledged to have been poor to middling. the circumstances of the Hungarian GP were also exceptional. [[User:Mark83|Mark83]] 19:37, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

::It has been reported in the Telegraph (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/motorsport/formulaone/5369856/Monaco-Grand-Prix-Jenson-Buttons-playboy-days-behind-him.html) that Nick Fry owns a proportion of the team, and in an earlier article, that he owns the majority stake. Shouldn't this be added?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/92.239.225.23|92.239.225.23]] ([[User talk:92.239.225.23|talk]]) 23:17, 28 May 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Klein-Glienicke Schweizerhaus 1.jpg|thumb|320px|''Schweizerhaus'' in [[Klein Glienicke]] near [[Berlin]], designed by [[Ferdinand von Arnim]], 1867]]
'''Swiss chalet style''' ({{lang-de|Schweizerstil}}, {{lang-no|Sveitserstil}}) is an [[architectural style]] of [[Historicism (art)|Late Historicism]], originally inspired by rural [[chalet]]s in [[Switzerland]] and the [[Alps|Alpine]] (mountainous) regions of [[Central Europe]]. The style refers to traditional building designs characterised by widely projecting roofs and facades richly decorated with wooden balconies and carved ornaments. It spread over [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Austria-Hungary]] and [[Scandinavia]] during the ''[[Belle Époque]]'' era.

==History==
[[File:Villa Fridheim, Krøderen, 2.jpg|thumb|Villa Fridheim in [[Krødsherad]], Norway]]
Swiss chalet style originated in the [[German Romanticism|Romantic]] era of the late-18th/early-19th century, when the ideas of the [[English landscape garden]] inspired parks and residences in Germany, such as the [[Dessau-Wörlitz Garden Realm]]. It became highly appreciated on the continent by noble landowners who were impressed by the &quot;simple life&quot; of people living in the mountains. 

The chalet style soon spread over the German ''[[Mittelgebirge]]'' landscapes such as the [[Harz]] mountains or the [[Dresden]] area and the adjacent [[North Bohemia]]n region. As a &quot;modern&quot; building style, it also influenced the [[resort architecture]] along the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] seaside, like in [[Binz]] or [[Heringsdorf, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|Heringsdorf]]. Around 1900, design elements were used in the construction of numerous bourgeois family homes as well as by notable architects like [[Heinrich von Ferstel]] to build larger mansions and hotels. 

The style was further popularized by the first waves of tourism of rich people from the North and West of Europe and became popular in other parts of Europe and North America, notably in the [[architecture of Norway]], [[architecture of Iceland|Iceland]] and [[Architecture of the Netherlands|the Netherlands]] and in the [[country house]] architecture of [[architecture of Sweden|Sweden]] and [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati (Ohio, USA)]], in the late 19th and early 20th century. English examples of the chalet style include the [[Boathouse at Belton House]], [[Lincolnshire]], by [[Anthony Salvin]] and the Swiss Cottage at [[Osbourne House]], on the [[Isle of Wight]], constructed for [[Queen Victoria]]'s children.

==Characteristics==
The style is characterized by:
*[[Gabled roof|Gabled roofs]] with wide [[eaves]]
*Exposed construction beams, including large [[Bracket (architecture)|brackets]]
*Decorative carving and mouldings
*[[Balconies]]
*Large windows
*[[Weatherboarding]], usually painted, often in bright colors

The result was '''delete'''. -- [[User:Jitse Niesen|Jitse Niesen]] ([[User talk:Jitse Niesen|talk]]) 12:28, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

:In case anybody requires an explanation how I arrived at this decision, as it is a bit borderline: There seems to be only one reliable source, an article repeated in USA Today and other media. What tipped the balance is firstly the weak reasons in some of the &quot;keep&quot; comments (specifically, those of necronudist, Portillo, and I don't understand Minfo); and secondly, I think we should be extremely cautious in having articles about living children. -- [[User:Jitse Niesen|Jitse Niesen]] ([[User talk:Jitse Niesen|talk]]) 12:45, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

* '''Delete''' - he's ten years old, for crying out loud. If he makes it as a pro then add him in but not until then. [[User:Qwghlm|Qwghlm]] 20:09, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
**'''Comment''' You can't delete or not delete an article purely based on age. --[[User:Pinkkeith|Pinkkeith]] 20:11, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
***'''Comment''' - the point is that he doesn't meet [[WP:BIO]]. There are thousands of kids with potential; they get articles here when that potential is realised by playing for the first team of a significant club. WP is not a crystal ball. [[User:BlueValour|BlueValour]] 20:53, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
****'''Comment''' Well, that wasn't the point that you made, but it does pass [[WP:BIO]] based on [[WP:GOOGLE]]. There is no crystal ball to this article at all, it is all based on present information and known fact. --[[User:Pinkkeith|Pinkkeith]] 21:00, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
*****'''Comment''' What &quot;known fact?&quot;  There is not a single source cited in the entire article.  I am particularly leery of this becoming another AFD where the article is kept because of references cited in the AFD discussion that never make it into the article thus defeating the entire purpose of this discussion and [[WP:V]].  --[[User:ElKevbo|ElKevbo]] 14:26, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
*We can, however, '''delete''' an article if no reliable sources are provided when challenged under [[WP:V|verifiability policy]].  Pinkkeith, can you point us to featured coverage in mainstream media?  Some of those are needed to let us keep the article.  Being signed to a youth team isn't notable enough to get thousands of other kids their own WP articles.  [[User:Barno|Barno]] 20:39, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
** Here is a [http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/technology/maney/2005-02-01-maney_x.htm USA Today article] on him. In there the writer mentions that he was covered in numerous other newspapers. --[[User:Pinkkeith|Pinkkeith]] 20:43, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
*** - fine but he has achieved nothing in the adult world - the press references are the result of a splendid publicity campaign for his video but that doesn't confer notability. [[User:BlueValour|BlueValour]] 20:57, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
**** That's blatent [[ephebiphobia]]. Reread the article, the entire article is talking about the video and how it made him notable. --[[User:Pinkkeith|Pinkkeith]] 21:01, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

[http://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=%22Jean+Carlos+Chera%22&amp;btnG=Search+Archives&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8 Google News Archive] search yields 74 unique hits- more than enough to qualify as &quot;the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person.&quot; How old the subject is and the method in which he was made notable isn't relevant; the subject meets [[WP:BIO]]. --[[User talk:Rory096|Rory096]] 21:14, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
:*'''Comment''' - most of the content, apart from his birthdate, fails [[WP:V]]. The Ghits mean we can keep the article not that we must. They are all the result of a single video being published on the internet and they have all picked up the same story.

[[User:BlueValour|BlueValour]] 16:58, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''-So he's a child prodigy, that doesn't make him notable.  Some of my friends are amazing at basketball, but they don't have any articles.  As above, if he makes it to the pros (or college, if Brazil has a college league, I dunno), then we can always repost.

*'''Delete'''  When he has played for Manchester United, Arsenal, Porto, Eindhoven or Real Madrid he will have earned his article.  Until then it is worth remembering that, at least in the UK, it would be highly improper for professional clubs to express an interest in a 10 year old, let alone to 'openly court' them.

*'''Delete''' I've reviewed some of these news articles. I can read only the English ones, which are basically the same novelty one-shot story, repeated, or something like the USA today story, which is more about how everyone is famous on the Internet than a biographical source for an article.

Many of the users are very bias against the idea of a 7yr old having its own article or the fact that his only a child prodigy, but indeed we have a child prodigy article. Im definately getting a sense of outright bias and a feeling that many of the voters here are americans. [[portillo]]

*'''Comment''' - I think most of the delete (and some of the keep) votes are completely missing the point. Of course this kid isn't a notable footballer. He is however notable as an internet/media phenomenon. Wikipedia has plenty of articles for such people, as an example go look at [[Mahir Çağrı]]. Then at the bottom of his page have a look at the categories he's placed in. When someone comes to Wikipedia and searches for &quot;that kid i saw clips of on TV&quot; or &quot;that kid my mate sent me videos of&quot; and who's name give 35,000 google hits... He should be here! [[User:Alii h|aLii]] 15:20, 6 November 2006 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' per norm. [[User:Minfo|м info]] 23:03, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - I wonder if there is a misunderstanding here? If you are a child prodigy as a piano player you can play the piano. If you are a child prodigy as a mathematician you can do complicated sums in your head. Here, the kid undoubtedly has unusual ball skills but that doesn't make him a footballer. I also don't see him as a 'internet/media phenomenon' with any longevity - with YouTube such phenonima come and go like snow in the sun. [[User:TerriersFan|TerriersFan]] 00:01, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
:He was born as a YouTube phenomen but now he's known by all of the users above, has google entries and BBC articles. Guys, you wanna delete him, let's do it. Simply there are people who search for him and people who know him, there are many articles on paper magazines about him, but if you are too zealous to keep a 9-years-old top-youngster 'cause &quot;well, dear Watson, it fails WP:BIO =_= ahem&quot; let's do it. Do it and stop arguing bullshits. --[[User:Necronudist|necronudist]] 09:24, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

The '''European Federation of [[Financial Analyst]]s Societies''' ('''EFFAS''')[http://www.effas.com] is the federation of [[financial analyst|analysts]] associations in Europe. EFFAS comprises 27 member societies representing more than 14,000 investment professionals. EFFAS was founded in 1962 and the headquarters is located in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]].

Besides its European training programme CEFA (Certified European Financial Analyst) EFFAS also grants the Certified International Investment Analysts (CIIA) designation, ensuring professional qualification by offering global as well as local market knowledge within its examination structure. As a global designation the exams can be taken in different languages. Through the national member societies EFFAS provides a full range of services for capital market experts.

==CIIA Certification==
EFFAS participates in further developing the [[Certified International Investment Analyst]] (CIIA) examinations, a financial analyst designation recognised globally. Analysts who belong to European analyst associations that are members of EFFAS, are eligible to participate in the final CIIA examination, if they pass the foundation and the national exams, or if they hold the Certified European Financial Analyst diploma (CEFA).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Big Andy, (Andrew Walsh) was born in Louisville, Ky., on Feb. 12, 1978.  His father, Frank Walsh and mother, Marsha Sils were overly delighted to have him, since their first son, Patrick, was a dud.  Big Andy was known through his childhood as being pretty funny.  His brother, not so much.  His parents divorced in 1981, after his father recuperated from emergency brain surgery, after falling through the roof at his work and landing head first on the concrete below.  He continued to work there until he passed away after a 3 year battle with melanoma, in 2006, a week before his 54th birthday.  His mom remarried and had another child, a daughter named Brittani (Gamble).</text>

{{Wikipedia subcat guideline|notability criteria|{{PAGENAME}}|[[WP:NMS]]&lt;br&gt;[[WP:SCIENCE]]}}
--&gt;
{{rejected}}

Ideas related to science are an important part of any comprehensive [[WP:ENC|encyclopedia]].  This guideline and its criteria are intended for use in determining whether a topic is notable due to being a part of or related to science.  The tests in this guideline are intended to be fairly rigirous so that a topic that is acceptable under this guideline can be considered an appropriate part of Wikipedia.  However, the failure of a topic to meet this guideline's criteria does not automatically exclude it, as it may attain notability through [[WP:N]] itself or another of its subsidiary guidelines.

==Notability of topics related to science==

The need for this guideline comes from there being a set of topics which do not fail the test of the [[Wikipedia:No original research|No original research]] policy or the [[Wikipedia:Attribution]] policy but which none the less are not appropriate to Wikipedia because they do have sufficient notability.  Such topics mostly represent new findings and theories, as well as past findings and theories that have failed to gain significant attention in either scientific circles or the public at large (or so far failed to gain said attention).

A key element to understanding this guideline is that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a research publication, and as such Wikipedia does not usurp the usual validation processes of scientific institutions such as [[peer review]], [[scientific consensus]], and academic recognition. Decisions about including or excluding material must always reflect the opinions of outside authorities, not those of Wikipedia editors. Inclusion or exclusion is therefore not a judgement on the validity, importance or accuracy of a scientific contribution, but simply a reflection of the quality and quantity of responses it received inside and outside the [[scientific community]].

This [[WP:N|notability guideline]] derives its relevance from the policies [[WP:NOT|What Wikipedia is not]] (in particular [[WP:NOT#IINFO|Not an indiscriminate collection of information]] and [[WP:NOT#CRYSTALBALL|Not a crystal ball]]), [[WP:NOR|No original research]] and [[WP:NPOV|Neutral point of view]] (in particular [[WP:NPOV#Undue weight|Undue weight]] and [[Wikipedia:Neutral point  of view/FAQ#Pseudoscience|Pseudoscience]]), as well as the guidelines [[Wikipedia:Conflict of interest|Conflict of interest]] and [[WP:AUTO|Autobiography]]. Also of importance are [[WP:V|verifiability]] and [[WP:RS|reliability]] policies.

==Criteria==
=== General ===
In general, a contribution in the field of science is notable enough to merit inclusion in Wikipedia if it meets at least one of the following criteria:

#'''Textbook science.''' There is regular non-incidental mention of the contribution in general or specialized textbooks published by reputable presses.{{ref|1|1}}
#'''Widely cited.''' Papers covering the contribution have been widely cited{{ref|2|2}} in its research field{{ref|3|3}} relative to other papers in the same area. Self-citations, and citations in journals which are not respected within the relevant research field should be excluded.
#'''Press and fiction.''' It is or was well known due to extensive press coverage, or due to being a recurrent theme in notable works of [[fiction]]. In this case the article should make note of this status. A single article on the theory, even if from a major media source such as ''[[New Scientist]]'' or ''[[Scientific American]]'', is not a sufficient criterion.
#'''Historical interest.''' It has historically met any of the above criteria within the scientific community or the culture at large but has since either been [[superseded scientific theory|superseded]], disregarded, or dismissed by the scientific community or the culture at large. The article should make note of the subject's status in this regard.
#'''Popular belief.''' It is or was believed to be true by a significant part of the general population, even if rejected by scientific authorities.

Notable topics which are primarily non-scientific in nature but which contain claims concerning scientific phenomena, should not be handled as scientific.  For example, the ''[[Book of Genesis]]'' itself is primarily covered as a religious scripture rather than as a cosmology. On the other hand, subjects such as [[creationism]] or [[creation science]], which involve a direct conflict between scientific and religious doctrine, are properly evaluated both on a scientific and theological basis. Similarly, subjects purporting to have a scientific basis may be noteworthy primarily on cultural or sociological bases, such as UFOs, which can usefully be discussed from several different perspectives.

:{{Seealso|Wikipedia:Notability (science)/Irrelevant arguments}}

===Scientific terms===
:''See also [[Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms]]
A scientific term is considered notable and worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia if the following can be established:
# A commonly agreed-upon formal or informal definition
# A trajectory of use for the term in the scientific literature from [[WP:RS|reliable]] and [[WP:V|verifiable]] sources
To determine notability it is important to keep in mind that different fields sometimes use the same term to describe different concepts. On the other hand, especially in the early stages of a field, terminology is often not standardized and different terms are used for the same concept. The policy on [[WP:NAME|naming conventions]] gives more information on the choice of the proper term when more than one term is used in the scientific literature.

== Assessing the reliability and relevance of sources ==

Journals from which citations and evidence of notability are obtained are expected to be well known and respected within the relevant research field.  The previous requirement of citation from a peer-reviewed source is not alone sufficient by this requirement.  (Peer review is done just as easily by a fringe science journal as by a leading journal, while [[Nature (journal)|Nature magazine]], one of the most respected [[scientific journals]] in existence, uses editorial as well as  peer review for submissions.)

Textbooks should either be well-known and respected or produced by a reputable scientific publisher (which is most likely the same publisher as one or more respected journals).

Journals from scientific societies of developing countries are occasionally not reliable.  If a finding in such a journal should prove to be of great scientific interest, that finding is often reprinted and/or reported in reliable scientific sources.  In such a case, the original journal article can be cited as a primary source, but its relevance should be backed up by secondary citations in known reliable sources.

For biographical articles and articles on fringe science, there is some loosening of these requirements.  Works by the topic of a biographical article are relevant to the article whether their writing was published in a reliable journal/publisher or not.  Also, the contents of a journal devoted to a fringe science can provide evidence as to the past or current thinking within that fringe field.  However, the fringe science journals cannot provide evidence for the outright notability of the topic.

==Notes==
{{note|1|Note 1}}:  The scientific contribution must have a major entry in the work. A passing mention of the concept is not sufficient. 

{{note|2|Note 2}}:  Citation counts and peer review mechanisms differ vastly between sciences, fields, and subfields, and editors are urged to inform the relevant [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Council/Directory/Science|WikiProject]] about ongoing debates to get expert input. It should also be noted that ''quantity'' of citations is often only a poor approximation of ''quality''.

{{note|3|Note 3}}:  A &quot;research field&quot; indicates an established area of study for which the topic in question is only a part.  A topic cannot be its own research field, nor can it gain notability from being part of a field which is non-notable.

__NOTOC__
===Overview===
After much deliberation of the [[Wikipedia:Danny's contest/Contest entries|contest entries]] the judges have arrived at a decision.

The entries could be broken down into three broad groups... entries that didn't seem to have much, if any, improvement, entries that were a &quot;good try&quot; and a handful of entries that really took the contest to heart and added a lot of interesting and germane references.

===Criteria===
The judges graded on 4 major criteria:
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!Criterion
!Description
!Weight
|-
|'''Number of citations'''
|Just a  raw count of how many were added. This was a good filter to see if the article could make the finalists... only 2 or 3 refs suggested that maybe not so much had been done.  
|(20%)
|-
|'''Complexity of citations'''
|A gauge of the difficulty level of adding them. Were they notes? web cites? book cites? did they use ISBN tagging? were there multiple places that got the same note? Notes ON notes? 
|(30%)
|-
|'''Appropriateness of cites'''
|Were they actually GOOD cites that moved the article forward?
|(20%)  
|-
|'''Overall article improvement'''

|'''[[Battle of Ceresole]]'''
|An important battle in medieval history, part of the [[Italian Wars]] series. Characterised by contemporaries as &quot;marvellously confused&quot; this battle is attractively illustrated with lots of maps and diagrams. One would expect Kyrill as coordinator of [[WP:MILHIST]] to do a good job of improving an article, and Kyrill does not disappoint. A very powerful article about an interesting battle.

|'''[[Theramenes]]'''
|An important general and historical figure of ancient Greece, including participating in an Athenian coup, multiple battles, and a rebellion. He even had notoriety after death. The article is challenging due to a paucity of sources, but Robth found 80+ cites. There also is an innovative organisation of sources into modern and ancient. A very good article based on some painstaking research.

|'''[[Crawford expedition]]'''
|A very understudied but important battle in the [[American Revolution]]. The winning side often tends to ignore battles they lost, and this article was not much more than a single paragraph stub when Kevin went to town on it. It is now profusely illustrated with maps, paintings, tables and diagrams and has grown to 43 Kb. In addition to 88 high quality footnotes, it also has a comprehensive &quot;references&quot; and &quot;for further reading&quot; section, properly separated out. All books have good ISBN links. This article is a real tour de force and shows the power of our encyclopedia well.

That all of these articles were somehow military related was surely coincidence! :)

'''Joe Eubanks''' (born 1975) is an [[United States|American]] [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] best known by the [[ring name]] '''Lobo'''. He wrestled primarily in [[Combat Zone Wrestling]] (CZW), where he won every major championship and was the first inductee into the [[CZW Hall of Fame]] in 2004. He was formerly the CZW Commissioner/Talent Coordinator.&lt;ref name=&quot;Online World of Wrestling&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/040207.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling 5th Anniversary Show February 7, 2004 - Philadelphia, Pennsylvania - ECW Arena|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===1999-2002===
Along with [[Nick Gage]], [[Justice Pain]], and [[Ric Blade]], Lobo was trained by [[John Zandig]] at the CZW Wrestling School and graduated first in the class.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freewebs.com/andy_czw1/history.html CZWHookup : The history of CZW] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210134119/http://www.freewebs.com/andy_czw1/history.html |date=2008-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He became one of the main wrestlers in CZW along with other graduates from the school. In February 1999, Lobo became the second [[CZW Iron Man Championship|Iron Man Champion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Online World of Wrestling&quot;/&gt; He held the title until June when he lost it to Justice Pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/990619.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling - CZW Down in Flames June 19, 1999 - Mantua, NJ |accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two continued wrestling each other and competed in the first ever Cage of Death match at the first ''Cage of Death'' show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/991016.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling - CZW Cage of Death October 16, 1999 - Mantua, NJ|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lobo won the match and regained the title. He would lose this title to [[Matt Prince|Wifebeater]], but regain it one more time the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/000311.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling - CZW March Violence March 11, 2000 - Sewell, NJ|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lobo also challenged for the [[CZW World Heavyweight Championship|CZW Heavyweight Championship]]. He feuded with Zandig for the title and finally beat him in July 2000. He held the title until ''Cage of Death II''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/000909.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling - CZW Cage of Death II....After Dark September 9, 2000 - Sewell, NJ|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that show, Lobo successfully defended the championship against Zandig in the Cage of Death match. Directly following this match, Justice Pain came out and fought Lobo in another Cage of Death match. In the match, Lobo was thrown from the top of the cage to the ground through a table covered in barbed wire. Justice Pain went on to win the match and the title.&lt;ref name=&quot;Online World of Wrestling&quot;/&gt;  After losing the title, Lobo continued feuding with Zandig. This time, the feud was for ownership of CZW. On February 9, 2002, Lobo defeated Zandig to become the new owner of CZW. He held this position until ''Cage of Death IV'' when Zandig defeated him to regain his position as CZW's owner &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/021213.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling December 13, 2002 - Philadelphia, PA - Viking Hall|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2003-present===
He took some time off from CZW following the Cage of Death match. While he was gone, a new group called the Hi-V tried to take over CZW, with Zandig as their main target. Zandig was planning to face the Hi-V at ''Cage of Death V'', but the stable outnumbered his team 6 to 4. At ''Night of Infamy II'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/031115.html|title=Night of Infamy II - November 15, 2003 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lobo made a shocking return to help Zandig and join his team just in time for Cage of Death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/031213.html|title=Cage of Death V December 13, 2003 - Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their team was successful. In February 2004, Lobo became the first inductee to the CZW Hall of Fame. After this, Lobo remained inactive for the following two years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Online World of Wrestling&quot;/&gt;

At [[Cage of Death 7]], [[Zandig]], who had turned on the fans, wanted to run CZW the way they used to. He called out Lobo, who was backstage for the event, and they joined each other along with [[Justice Pain]] and [[Nick Gage]]. They would later call themselves the Forefathers of CZW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/_2006/|title=2006 results

*'''Speedy Delete''' - for blatant advertising.  I waited a bit to see how this one would play out before making a decision, but as much good faith as I normally assume, there is no sticking up for this one.  The article's [[User:Kobius|prime editor]] (and incidentally, the forum admin) removed the AfD tag from the page and does not take kindly to other editors touching 'his' page.  The whole layout of the article is clearly trying to draw viewers into the forums, perhaps to meet the admitted goal of 500,000 posts.  Add these to the issues others have pointed out and there's really no need for further discussion.

The Anizone is a large site and I think if someone wants to find out more about it they come to the best internet dictionary in the world and they research on of the largest best sites. The site has a largely amount of fair people considering it has been hacked three times. The admin accidently remoe it thinking it would be delete and he was not the maker of the page but it was I.

==BBC News Report and the pilot &quot;looking for a good place to crash&quot;==

The BBC article states that the pilot was looking for a good place to put the aircraft down; he missed some park and instead put the aircraft down in an uninhabited area near Stockport city centre. The evidence does not justify this supposition whatsoever. For one thing, the AIB report states that the aircraft was likely uncontrollable after the engines cut out, and might not have been controllable even before then. The first officer died and the captain suffered retrograde amnesia, so we don't know what went on in the cockpit. There isn't the tiniest shred of evidence that the pilot &quot;put the aircraft down&quot; someplace safe. It was likely just coincidence - there are a lot of empty or disused areas around airports and under approach paths (and *that* is often deliberate).

This is such a common urban legend/media foofah. Every time a plane doesn't actually fall out of the sky, some media type comes up and says the pilot was &quot;looking for a place to crash that wouldn't cause injuries on the ground&quot;. I don't blame the Wikipedian who put this in at all, because he/she likely didn't have any sources other than the BBC article. I am blaming the BBC for making a supposition not supported by the facts.

I suppose people want to think that in an emergency the first thing the pilot will do is look for a safe place to crash. It makes them feel less worried about an aircraft crashing into their home, school, or place of business. It ain't necessarily so, though; in fact it almost is never so. Aircraft about to crash are more often than not uncontrollable - that's why they crash. --[[User:Charlene.fic|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot; face=&quot;Matisse ITC&quot;&gt;Charlene&lt;/font&gt;]] 19:40, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

Edited to add: The cause of the accident wasn't &quot;pump failure&quot; (boo, BBC, again). It was a design error in the fuel line. --[[User:Charlene.fic|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot; face=&quot;Matisse ITC&quot;&gt;Charlene&lt;/font&gt;]] 20:02, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

:Apologies. That would have been my factual faux pas. Thank you for correcting my blathering and making this article respectable. :) [[User:Legion89|Legion]] 13:56, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

A second's more flight and the plane would catastrophically have taken the tower off Stockport's fine Town Hall and crashed into the facade of the (then) infirmary opposite the Town Hall, blocking the main road between that runs from Manchester through Stockport to the south - AG, Stockport.

== Additional cause of this crash ==

I remember seeing a BBC program about this crash. It reported on the findings of the inquiry. It said that there was an additional reason for the crash.

Apparently, the engine speeds were shown in the cockpit on two dials, one for each wing. Each dial had two hands, one for each engine and each labelled with the engine number.

This had been serviced, and a mistake had been made so that engine 3 was connected to the hand marked &quot;4&quot;, and engine 4 to hand &quot;3&quot;.

I think it was engine 4 that was starved of fuel. The pilot saw from the dial that engine 3 had stopped, so he switched off / feathered engine 3. Now both engines on the right wing were out. (This would explain why engine 4 was windmilling.)

As part of the investigation, they tried flying a similar aircraft with engines 3 and 4 both out, and discovered that the aircraft could not be flown properly.

Now, I mention all this because it is an interesting story. Also, because I want to apply the moral to setting up a computer cluster. I want to avoid the possibility of one computer failing and a different one being taken out for service by mistake, thereby bringing down the cluster. 

Does anyone know more about this? [[User:Mm67|Mm67]] 11:44, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

==Is [[Wikipedia:Notability (science)]] a consensus guideline?==
Please state your position, '''yes''' or '''no''', explain your position and defend it.  This is not a vote.  [[User:SmokeyJoe|SmokeyJoe]] 10:47, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Yes''' I consider it one, and I'm not sure what objection people have - if there's a problem that needs fixing, let's fix it.  I already refer to it, guideline or not, since it's very useful.  --[[User:Minderbinder|Minderbinder]] 12:38, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Yes''' Not only is it a consensus guideline, it is absolutely vital for Wikipedia to have such a guideline. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 12:51, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Yes''' I certainly support this guideline, what it is trying to do, and how it is trying to achieve it. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:10, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Yes''' We're ready to go into the stage where changes should be discussed here before being implemented in the policy page. ~ [[User:Trialsanderrors|trialsanderrors]] 17:40, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Absolutely''' We've numerous AfDs and arbcom cases which have documented that this is the community's intent. --[[User:EngineerScotty|EngineerScotty]] 17:44, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* I don't see where the proposed criteria add meaningful advice to writters or evaluators, and the preamble/text is way too long to be practical.  Please cite some examples of AfD where this proposal would have ensured an outcome other than what would have been achieved under the current guidelines.  For each of the criteria now listed I belive that proper application of WP:N and WP:ATT would acheive the same results.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 17:54, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
** There is [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Electric universe (concept)]], where this standard helped to refine the arguments that finally got the topic removed.  The aupporters trying to use this guideline to buoy their cause ended up only showing all the more that the article did not belong in Wikipedia.  &lt;br&gt;You are correct that in the end articles that are removed will be so removed (or not) due to policy concerns.  The need for this guideline comes from its ability to focus the debate on the issues that are important in the relevant cases.  In other words, it helps to achieve the &quot;proper application&quot; that you are claiming makes this guideline irrelevant. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 18:22, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
*** EMS, could your purpose be acheived with an essay?  Among the problems with permutations from guidelines and policies is the evolution into redundant and conficting guidance to the point that writers and evaluators become confused and the branches work at cross purposes.  My frequent analogy is the US Tax Code, which has bread several large industries for interpretation and application.  Writing complex rule sets requires great skill and caution. --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 18:34, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
*** On review of the Electric universe (concept) AfD, it appears to be resoundingly rejected with the tools we already have, most convincingly original research and few reliable sources.  This outcome is consistent with other scientific and academic issues which I have seen defeated at AfD. An excellent nomination doesn't hurt either! --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 18:42, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
**** Right now I am wondering what your agenda is here, as this type of opposition usually comes from someone who has lost an AfD in part due to this and the guidelines and is seeking to water down the standards.  One of the factors that helped with the electric universe AfD was the the nominator was also working on this guideline and used its insights in writing the nom.  Beyond that, there is the basic issue of moving beyond &quot;peer review&quot; as a standard for inclusion, a test passed by numerous non-notable articles that I have seen.  Also, I at least have gone to some pains to couch this as a setting standard for inclusions instead of exclusion.  That way, an argument that &quot;X calls for inclusion&quot; renders this guideline moot as a refutation, and so avoids the types of conflicts that in our laws make being a lawyer such a profitable profession. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 19:16, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
***** My agenda is not as you assert, but your question is a fair one, which I will answer.  My agenda is clarity in the grand scheme of notability guidelines, without a specific prejudice to this proposal. Please visit the discussion page for WP:N to see that there are many people expressing concerns over the whole process.  I support the concept of &quot;encyclopedic suitability&quot;, which we call notablility at WP, for lack of a better name.  I also consider myself a moderate inclusionist.  I am a frequent participant in Afd.  You are correct in one respect, that I origninally became involved in AfD and notability, because I saw too many abuses by uninformed editors who were deleting meanigful articles, though not specifically in the field of science.  My interest is in history and sailing.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 19:33, 16 March 2007 (UTC) 
******Might I recommend that your &quot;no&quot; comment seems to be motivated more by a general dislike for [[WP:N]] rather than a specific distaste for this particular guideline. In particular, the motivation behind this guideline was in part due to a charge made during the [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Pseudoscience|Pseudoscience arbitrartion case]] that such a guideline should exist to fend off charges related to whether an idea was notable in a scientific sense. One can argue whether [[WP:N]] should exist or not, but that's not for us to decide here. It is absolutely not true that this guideline is redudant: there is no other place where it is indicated what makes a scientific idea notable for inclusion in the encyclopedia. [[WP:NOR]] doesn't help because &quot;originality&quot; is a vague concept related to heavily to [[WP:V]] and [[WP:COI]] to be useful when people just make random articles about ostensibly scientific subjects they read about online, for example. [[WP:A]] doesn't help because there are scientific ideas which are not notable (the general consensus of the community is that they do not belong in the encyclopedia) which nevertheless are attributable to reliable sources. [[WP:NPOV]] doesn't work because the exclusion criteria at [[WP:NPOV#Undue weight]] is unable to distinguish between majority and minority except by [[WP:CON|consensus]]. That's why this guideline is needed and why it is used. Look at all the pages that link here and tell me that it isn't referred to. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 13:09, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
* No, it's not.  I think the burden of some evidence that this guideline is widely supported and necessary needs to be shown from the supporters.  Right now it's an initiative, a proposal with stable wording.  However, even in the &quot;test cases&quot; that I looked at, it seems that this guideline isn't being referred to, and evaluation of the articles in question isn't done with these guidelines in mind, rather, articles are mainly evaluated from a point of view of adequate sourcing and original research issues, in other words, policies we already have.  (I do think the editors here have reached a reasonably stable consensus, though.  But that doesn't, to me, make a &quot;consensus guideline,&quot; which implies support from the community overall.)[[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:04, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
**The evidence is in the ''What links here'' tool you can access from the toolbox. I think that you may have a hidden agenda here: you tend to be a bit too quick to agree to a supression bias against non-experts in the fields of science. Is this a misplaced concern? --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 13:09, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
***First of all there are over 150 things that link to [[Wikipedia:Notability (science)]], so it's not unreasonable to expect evidence to be actually gathered by someone trying to make a case.  But more, I went to a few of those &quot;what links here&quot; and apparently the only reason they were linked was that trialsanderrors mentioned that the debate was a test case: not people actually referring to the guideline and trying to use it.  Look at the Electric Universe AfD, for instance, which is the best example I've seen of a borderline-notable scientific theory (where this guideline might help).  [[WP:SCIENCE]] was not used as an argument in the debate, even by you, and the arguments that led to it being deleted were not even much along the lines of what is presented here in the guideline, but were according to core Wikipedia policies like [[WP:ATT]], [[WP:OR]] and so on.  Some of the argument is covered here in the introduction, but the &quot;criteria&quot; part played no role and seems to be central to this as a notability guideline.  So, this is what I mean when I say that no evidence has been presented.  What do YOU mean when you say this is a consensus guideline?  [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:43, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
****The criteria part played a huge role. The only criteria that EU could have come close to satisfying was recognition in popular culture/outside media and we showed that it was not notable along those lines. The guidelines at the time were being formulated and weren't as clear as they are now, but thanks to discussions such as that AfD we have a clearer demarcation. I think you need to read through the AfD we reference again and look carefully at how the criteria line-up with the criteria outlined in this guideline. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:02, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
*****Could you show me precisely where?  I don't mean to be dense, but I really don't see it.  I see your point #5 in the nomination, but that sounds like the core [[WP:N]] argument, and not related to the criteria here.  And anyway, saying the the EU debate influenced [[WP:SCIENCE]] kind of precludes that the EU debate can be thought of as evidence that this is a consensus guideline.  Can you show me ANY AfD debate that explicitly references the criteria?  [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:17, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
******Number 5 in the nomination. While it doesn't explicitly reference this page, it does so implicitly (and if I recall correctly at the time the standards were still being developed as to which criteria were going to be grouped with which). --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:20, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
*******Again, #5 was really along the lines of basic [[WP:N]].  Again, show me any debates that explicitly reference the criteria.  There's a difference between this proposal being wise or balanced or sensible and it having ''broad community support.''  [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:44, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
********Basic [[WP:N]]&quot;? That's a bit of WikiLawyering I haven't come across before. The fact is that #5 has direct parallels to our criteria here. You can thrust your head in the sand over this all you want, but that's the plain truth of the matter. And now you reposition your attack to claim that there isn't &quot;broad community support&quot;, but let me remind you that arbcomm members entreatied the community to develop these standards in the first place and that by virtue of this being a Wiki it will end up as balanced and sensible as possible. I'm beginning to think you are being a stick-in-the-mud for reasons you aren't coming clean about. Help me out, explain to me why you always seem to be fighting against scientific accuracy at Wikipedia so I can [[WP:AGF|assume good faith]] towards your contributions. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 17:36, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
***I suggest you go read [[WP:AGF]] and actually take it to heart.  In our current discussion, you seem to have trouble differentiating between (1) my personal support or opposition of the proposal and (2) my arguing that the proposal isn't a &quot;consensus guideline&quot;, that is, that it doesn't have broad support.  This wouldn't be a very hard difference to understand if you had been assuming good faith of me in the first place.  For the record, I support some of what the proposal says but not all of it, but that wasn't the basis for my objections: calling the proposal a &quot;consensus guideline&quot; is wrong, because this is still a very new proposal, barely even stable enough to judge.  [[WP:PROF]] remained a proposal for a very long time, and finally became a guideline when it became apparent that the guideline had influenced the way decisions were being made, and that the community, de facto, embraced the guideline.  Creation of policies and guidelines is slow and for good reason, especially when actionable changes are being proposed (like the criteria here).

****I appreciate your candor regarding your opinions of the content of this guideline because that is precisely what concerns me. However, I do feel that you are being a bit oblique in your commentary. &quot;Policy creation is slow,&quot; is often the cry of those who want to slow things down, and people tend to drag their feet for a reason. To me and many of the other editors who commented above, this guideline is ''de facto'' in place and isn't a proposal because we as editors abide by it. As you know, Wikipedia policies and guidelines are not written to affect change in the encyclopedia, but rather are meant to describe what actively goes on in editing. A good number of those who say that this is a consensus guideline edit a lot of science-related articles and so should be the ones to tell whether or not this guideline applies. I don't see that you are actively doing this as such. I do see you stepping into disputes regarding science-related articles often, and there are many times I see these actions as being in something of a contravention of the guidelines outlined here. I am being very up-front about my distrust of your motivations, but in so doing I'm also trying to assume good-faith as much as I can. Part of assuming good-faith is being transparent about one's perceptions and I'm offering you the opportunity to explain yourself as transparently as possible so we can move on. I don't like being lectured about [[WP:AGF]] when I was the one who brought it up, it looks to me like you are asking me to turn a blind eye towards our long history here at the encyclopedia and I am honestly telling you I'm having a hard time doing it because of the nature of this particular dispute we're having. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 13:53, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
*****You are making false implications about me, and I want it to stop.  [[WP:CIV|Comment on my comments]].  You say this is an attempt to document how Wikipedia works?  I respectfully disagree -- this talk page and its archives are full of debates about what the criteria ''should'' be, with very little discussion or analysis of how things are actually decided now.  (Some, but not much.)  From perusing the test cases, it seems to me that people are nearly exclusively deciding on these cases on the basis of [[WP:OR]], [[WP:ATT]], and [[WP:NPOV]], (and to a degree, [[WP:N]]), without much need for arguments specific to issue that the topics under discussion are scientific ones.  Since that ''isn't'' the content of this proposal, I cannot agree that this is documenting current Wikipedia practice, but if you want to try to change my mind, please show me specific examples so we can discuss them.  In any case, you should advertise this debate on [[WP:VPR]]; the general Wikipedia community should have a chance to comment.

******Whether they are false or not, they are simply my questions regarding your, frankly, obstinate resistance to this particular document. I am trying to be as forthright as possible here, and your increasingly haughty responses only confuse me further since you still haven't addressed directly my concerns regarding the history we have surrounding issues such as this. I disagree that the discussions are centering around how things &quot;should&quot; be. Rather I see discussions centering around generalizing from the experience that editors have. You also seem to be under the opinion that just because people reference older and more established policies and guidelines they aren't also considering this guideline. This I find to be particularly problematic because it ignores the words of people that aren't appended with a WP-acronym. Just because somebody doesn't cite this directly doesn't mean that you can't see the criteria being applied (as per our earlier discussion on EU deletion). I would hope that you would look more closely at the deletion discussions surrounding this and see if you can't spot the criteria in action. I am not going to advertise the debate anywhere, but you are free to do so. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 16:27, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
*******I've advertised the debate at [[WP:VPR]].  In terms of the status: you see one thing, I see another thing.  I'm not going to change my opinion by simply being told &quot;please look more closely,&quot; although you could convince me if you actually showed me some evidence.  I do see a lot of attempts at guiding the community: take a look at [[#&quot;Conference topic&quot; is a backdoor]], for instance, or [[#One final thought]]: people are discussing how to make a good rule, not what the rule is, organically.

****I'm with SA here: [[WP:N]] is being criticized partly because of its extreme generality.  No reason to think the entire idea of notability for all topics must pause just because of that.

****  The problem lies less with any individual sub-guideline, but more with a plethora of permutations leading to confusion.

***** I don't see any bedlam here.  I see this as being a well crafted guideline that is dealing with issues which are out-of-scope for the more general guideline due to its broad nature.  This guideline deals with the issues of science and science-related topics, and how to implement the notability guidelines within that context.&lt;br&gt;I have looked at the [[WP:N]] discussion and I get the feeling that you are doing your best to create uncertainty and confusion there.  And now you are trying to do the same here.  I for one have no need for it, and support this guideline as a reflection of the legitimate sense of the science editors here as to what is valid. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 18:23, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
*Yes, this appears to be a consensus guideline. The opposition to this guideline proposal may be part of a campaign in which User:Kevin Murray in the past month has placed &quot;rejected&quot; , &quot;disputed&quot; , or &quot;historical&quot; , or &quot;essay&quot; labels on about a dozen notability proposals or guidelines or has nominated them for deletion on the grounds that there was no consensus or that they constituted &quot;instruction creep&quot; or were redundant. A proposal is not necessarily impossible to reach consensus upon just because a few editors oppose it.

** I see your point.  This editor really, really has a grudge against the concept of notability, and I would love to know why.  If you want to do a [[WP:RfC]] against him, I am will be happy to second it.  This is ridiculous. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 19:42, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
*** No EMS, this editor, has a &quot;grudge&quot; against needless and redundant rule making for the sake of rule making.  I strongly support the concept of encyclopedic suitability which we call &quot;notability&quot; at WP.  This is not &quot;ridiculous&quot; but based on observations from life experience, that too many conficting rules create confusion rather than clarity.  Complex rule-sets require incredible cross coordination among the permutations, which is not happening here at WP, as guidelines are multiplying like rabbits without consideration of the big picture.  If you propose an RfC, please do so in the best interest of WP, not &quot;against&quot; me; this is not personal and reviewing the discussions will reveal that my actions are well supported.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 14:18, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
****There are plenty of Wikipedians who [[WP:IAR|agree with you about hating rules]]. However, might I suggest that you are going about it the wrong way. We are here writing this guideline because we need to summarize what has been done in regards to this issue. Your own personal distaste for the way in which editors have gone about doing this is probably best argued elsewhere: it certainly has nothing to do with whether consensus exists for this particular guideline. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:29, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
*** I do not see '''any''' need to coordinate this guideline with any other guidelines beside [[WP:N]] itself.  Although I am doing my own &quot;[[WP:NOR|original research]]&quot;, I have seem enough -uh- &quot;stuff&quot; offered by others such that I see a need to draw a firm and reasonable as to what is and is not acceptable here.  Until it has some reasonable amount of recognition in the scientific community, I see an article on my ideas as being an abuse of Wikipedia.  Yet I am unusual in that most other editors of Wikipedia with alternate ideas are here to promote those ideas, and they hate guidelines like this one with a purple passion because they help to keep their OR out.&lt;br&gt;BTW - I do see where you have had some success with you anti-Notability campaign.  Personally I think that you are doing Wikipedia a real disservice with it, and what you are stifling is not a bunch useless rule-making but instead needed elaborations on the meaning of Notability in various domains.  As has been noted in [[Wikipedia_talk:Notability|the WP:N discussion]], there is a level of subjectiveness in determining notability.  The need for these subsidary guidelines is to limit that subjectiveness, and thereby make this concept more usable.  Instead you are trying to pull the rug out from under Notability, something that will make the removal of questionable material much more difficult than it should be. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 16:08, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''the real test''' is whether the guidelines here will be accepted in practice. Both the above positions are to some degree correct: the guideline should reflect what its eds. believe to be the common feeling of the community, but it shouldalso point in the direction of where the consensus appears to be moving, and to be making recommendations from those most involved in edited these articles to guide thos less familiar. I think it will prove to be accepted because it is relatively straightforward, not complex -- at least by comparison -- and, in my view it does reflect the general voice. But we shall see. 
::The real dispute , I think, is over the notability of fringe science and whether that can be considered science in any sense at all. This is a matter in which I think there is in fact no real consensus, but at best a temporary majority, and i expect this  question to continue to be the theme of AfDs. I don't think this guideline  lays it to rest '''[[User:DGG|DGG]]''' 23:36, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
::: This guideline cannot and should not judge whether something is &quot;real science&quot;.  In fact, all that a determination that something is &quot;not science&quot; can do here is to remove a topic from being judged by this criteria with no resolution on its notability or lack thereof.  IMO, we have a set of criteria here such that anything that is meant to be judged as part of science can be ruled on here, be it mainstream or fringe.  What I think that you will find is that the least palatable topics are those which also have had the least impact and are also therefore the least notable.  --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 01:53, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

== Some suggestions on organizing this project page ==

* The introduction is too long.  Limit it to &quot;what&quot; and &quot;why&quot;.  Get the commentary (i.e. &quot;impetus&quot;) and discussion of process into its own section.  Specifically address what makes ''science'' different from other areas covered by the general guidelines.
* Criteria should define at least these categories as guidance to editors:
** topics which on their face should be include (i.e. the notable)
** topics which are going to require some judgments to be made by editors if they are new articles or added to existing articles. (i.e. the maybe notable)
** topics which, at least according to the authors of the guideline, are ''improbably'' included. (i.e. nonnotable)
* The statement ''&quot;Decisions about including or excluding material must always reflect the opinions of outside authorities, not those of Wikipedia editors.&quot;'' is bizarre because the opinion of Wikipedia editors is what, by definition, compose the Wikipedia. ''&quot;Must always&quot;'' is a rather strange term to be found in a mere ''guideline'' at any rate. [[User:Patsw|patsw]] 13:22, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

:: If you wish to draft an alternate version, the feel free to do so ''elsewhere'' and present it to us as a possible replacement.  We are certainly amenable to productive changes.  However, IMO the current project page works and should be considered a functioning guideline. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:13, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
:I agree the ''reflect outside authorities'' wording is odd (although not any odder than &quot;notability is not subjective&quot; which expresses the [[WP:ATT|same sentiment]]). The rest doesn't strike me as an improvement. ~ [[User:Trialsanderrors|trialsanderrors]] 17:49, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

::One point that isn't being made (in the intro) and probably should be is the point that scientific theories cannot be properly presented without understanding their level of acceptance.  There's a big difference between a mainstream theory and a fringe theory, and even in an article about a fringe theory, it's important to describe it as one.  However, for some fringe theories, insufficient sources exist to back up the claim that they are fringe theories.  Thus we are left with only one real choice: disallow the article, as we cannot properly cover it while adhering to [[WP:ATT]] and [[WP:NPOV]].  This is different from, say, an article about a band, where it may be that no source reports on their popularity or number of fans accurately, but sources do report on other things: the information we can't cover can just be left out.  In articles on science, we really can't leave that out.  [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:41, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

:::The &quot;level of acceptance&quot; argument makes no sense to me. &quot;Theory&quot; in science has a very precise meaning which applies to models and descriptions which are as completely accepted as possible in an endeavor based primarily on the dubious activity of inductive reasoning. While there is a big difference between mainstream and fringe proposals, the proposals themselves are only considered &quot;theories&quot; when they pass the tests of the scientific method. What makes a proposal fringe is, ostensibly, its inability to pass these tests. This doesn't mean that scientists don't make mistakes in pejoratively labeling the fringe out of the mainstream, only to say that the level of acceptance is something of a binary operator: either it's in or it's out. When an idea does not generate enough interest in the scientific community to create commentary from members of the community, it must either be uncontroversial (as is the case with textbook knowledge) or it must be outside the scientific community. This is quite easy to verify. No amount of posturing and insisting on the part of a fringe idea's proponents that the idea is actually &quot;scientific&quot; is good enough when demarcating for our purposes. We might still have articles on the idea if there is &quot;extra-scientific&quot; interest in it, but we do not need to shy away from being honest about its &quot;extra-scientific&quot; nature. One of the problems that many pro-fringe editors have is that they believe that because [[negative proof|proving the negative]] is in principle a defiance of [[WP:ATT]] that reasonable editors can't make editorial judgments with regards to the status of a particular idea. This is simply not the case at all: we are editing an encyclopedia not compiling a list of sources. After all, that's why we have editors in the first place: we are charged with summarizing the available data in the most conformist way possible. When all the data is outside the scientific community and the idea purports to have scientific importance, it is perfectly fine to delineate the contradiction. However, this discussion is probably better suited for [[WP:FRINGE]]. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:09, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

*I think it is a little more complicated than that.
*It is not ''necessary'' to give an indication of the acceptance of a theory, in order to describe it.
*And I don't think the word &quot;theory&quot; has such a precise meaning as scientists would like. For example, Wikipedia calls the [[Big Bang]] a &quot;theory&quot;, whereas the Encyclopedia Britannic calls it a &quot;Model&quot;. And I am sure there are more sources supporting both.
*This is why the new [[WP:A]] is so important. I can attribute both the Big Bang Theory, and the Big Bang Model, but I can find no source which agues it must be one or the other.
*I can also find no attribution labelling many minority subjects as &quot;fringe&quot;, nor claiming a certain level of acceptance. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 17:47, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

== Making this an approved guideline ==

I notice that Kevin Murray has downgraded this guideline back to the &quot;proposed&quot; status.  I would revert that myself, except that I am not at all clear by what action/authority it became considered a functioning guideline.  Certainly the above poll has produced only five people who support this as a guideline.  Even without the two nay-sayers I fail to see how the five of us constitute a group that can speak for the Wikipedia community as a whole, or at least the science editors.

I for one do call for the issue of approving this as a functioning guideline be presented to the community as a whole.  [[Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)|the Village Pump policy forum]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Science|WikiProject Science]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Physics|WikiProject Physics]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Chemistry|WikiProject Chemistry]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Biology|WikiProject Biology]] are all places where this guideline can be advertised and input and approval sought.  I see little danger in this and much promise, but mostly I would like to be able to show Kevin a formal approval so that is downgrading of this guideline cannot occur again. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 02:17, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

::We don't do &quot;formal&quot; and &quot;official&quot; with respect to guidelines. What matters is if this is (1) a good idea and (2) used as such in practice.

Judged by this talk page and AFD, the answer to all three is 'yes', so this page is a de facto guideline and Kevin is the lone dissenter here. Of course, putting a notice on the village pump never hurts.

:::Kevin is not the only dissenter, I also am.  Let me enumerate some general criticisms, this time relating to the substance of the proposal.  1.  There is not a big need for this.  Most science articles up for deletion are up for other concerns than notability, primarily, concerns that the article is original research, POV, or inadequately sourced.  Although there are many debates on the test pages subpage, in very few was the critical issue the notability of the subject: [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Electric universe (concept)]], [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Socionomics]], and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Growing Earth Theory]] (and the old debates, not listed there, about [[Time Cube]]).  2.  The list of criteria, a core part of this proposal, were not used as the basis of successful arguments in any of the key examples I listed.  Rather, the test seems to be the general one of being covered in multiple independent sources, inside or outside of the scientific community.  Note that the criteria give an opportunity to supporters of OR articles (real OR, not neutral attempts at describing published research) to argue for inclusion inappropriately: see [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sorce theory]] as an example of this.  The criteria have changed since then, but the same kind of argument could be made today.  I wouldn't want to jeopardize any of those debates by having a guideline here with such minimal applicability.  3.  The list of criteria is instruction creep and isn't useful.  For articles that should be deleted, not meeting the criteria doesn't make a strong argument.  For articles that should be kept, they're okay, but arguments to delete things that meet these criteria are weak delete arguments in the first place, usually along the lines of &quot;this article is in bad shape&quot;, see [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ubiquitous computing]] for example.  The criteria seem aimed at solving a non-existant problem of the over-deletion of notable science topics.

*The fundamental flaw of [[WP:SCIENCE|Notability (science)]], is that it tries to determine only whether an article is '''scientifically''' notable. It does not consider whether an article may be notable in '''any''' other area.

*: This is a true red herring IMO.  A failure of scientific notability does not mean that an article may have notability in another manner and therefore be worthy of inclusion.  I did have wording here to that effect at one time, but it seems to have been lost.  I will see to restoring that, as I see this guideline as being usable only as a means of inclusion.  For the purposes of exclusion, the failure of a topic to merit inclusion under any guideline (including this one) is the relevant matter. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:27, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
*:  (Edit conflict) Agree with EMS; The page clearly embraces the idea that popular notability for science topics is appropriate.  Since popular notability definitely is acceptable (see the [[Time Cube]] precedent, for instance), any wording that implies otherwise should be examined.  But you aren't correctly representing the main thrust of the proposal.

::*I did not suggest that failing scientific notability means that an article MUST be notable elsewhere. I wrote that it MAY be notable elsewhere. Yet the current policy does not consider this.
::*Deleting articles based on scientific notability alone, is an incredible conceit, and should play no part of the proposed guidelines. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 17:35, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
:::*I'm not sure what your point is.  If an article is scientifically notable, fine, it's keepable.  If an article is not notable scientifically, but notable in some other way (for example, in popular culture), fine, it's keepable.  But if the article is not notable in any way at all, why should it be kept?

::::*A number of articles have already been deleted, based on whether they were scientifically notable only, or worse, ''mainstream'' scientifically notable.

:::::* So what?  I see this as something that can and should happen.  If no other grounds are being offerred to justify notability, then the article should go.  I would point out that the deleted items cited as being &quot;non-mainstream&quot; are also considered &quot;non-notable&quot;, while other items have been kept as being &quot;notable&quot; but &quot;fringe&quot;.  It seems to me that this shows that this is a reasonable and workable scheme. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 22:09, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

::::::*No other grounds for notability are offered because the articles are considered only as to whether they are scientifically notable.
::::::*For example, the article on [[Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Ralph_Juergens|Ralph Juergens was deleted]] (a) based on a Scientific notability &quot;test case&quot; (b) on the grounds that he was a &quot;non-notable non-mainstream scientist&quot;, which is accurate, but no cause for deletion by itself.
::::::*It is improper for &quot;Notability (science)&quot; to '''solely''' judge any article for deletion, as it makes no attempt to attract expert editors in other fields --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 23:12, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

:::::::* If you are saying that a deleted article had another non-scince reason for being notable, then please name it and indicate why that reason was not considered at the time.  Also do note that in such cases a request for reconsideration can be made to [[Wikipedia:Deletion review]].  However, this standard is for determining notability with respect to science, and I find it to be quite silly and disingenuous to accuse this guideline of not doing something that it is not meant to so (namely seeking non-science-related reasons for inclusion). --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 01:56, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

::::::::* Ian, I hear you.  However your objections are ''way'' off base here, because what you don't like is that a consensus of Wikipedia editors has disagreed with your stance on certain topics.  That doesn't really have any bearing on whether or not that consensus exists.  You talk like [[WP:SCIENCE]] got Ralph Juergens deleted: no.  A consensus of editors and a discussion got it deleted, and frankly, it wasn't even based on [[WP:SCIENCE]] at all, more like on [[WP:BIO]] or [[WP:PROF]].

:::::::::*No, I am criticizing the make-up of the consensus, which is predominantly science-oriented editors who decided that Ralph Juergens was not notable because he was not a mainstream scientists; That is what the summary says. The AfD was not targeted outside of Notability (Science).
:::::::::*The main reason given for deletion of &quot;Ralph Juergens&quot; was that he &quot;is only published by vanity presses&quot;; not only is this false, but it fails civility guidelines,[[WP:COI#Importance_of_civility]]. Nevertheless, this was picked up by several other editors as their reasons for supporting the AfD.
:::::::::*But this is not the place to discuss a single article, but I offer this as an example. 
:::::::::*I think it is wholly inappropriate for WP:SCI to advertise articles for deletion. WP:NOTABLE should advertise AfD, giving a editors a chance to refer to WP:SCI and OTHER notability guidelines. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 10:46, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

==One researcher POV fails NPOV==
*The third paragraph includes an incorrect statement:
:&quot;the point of view of one researcher or research term and, unless it generates a significant outside response by the scientific community or the population at large, fails NPOV&quot;
*This is a complete misunderstanding of [[WP:NPOV|NPOV]]. If we attribute a statement to a single researcher, and it conforms to [[WP:A]] and is not misrepresented, then it conforms to NPOV. The argument is whether a statement by a single researchers is ''notable'', which is completely different. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 19:26, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

::*If another attributable view is available, we describe it. If it isn't, we don't pretend there might be one. There is no double whammy.
::*Describing the POV of one person does not automatically fail NPOV, and any decent editor can describe any POV in way that fulfils NPOV.
::*Quashing a POV on the grounds that there MIGHT be a hypothetical counter-POV, fails NPOV, fails WP:A, and fails WP:V. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 00:08, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

:::::*The only requirement to provide a balanced view, is if one exists. If it doesn't, then to pretend that a view &quot;needs balancing&quot;, is presumably based on the view of an unattributable, anonymous, expert-less editor. This fails numerous Wikipedia policies.

:::::*Yet both POVs are EQUALLY valid, as long as they are not misrepresented, and can easily be described in a manner that conforms to NPOV. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 13:15, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

:::::::What you fail to realize is that there is an informal community discussion as well as a formal publication discussion. Those who are in a particular community are aware of the informal discussion and are able to tell when a topic is ignored/scoffed or when it is accepted. This cannot be reported at Wikipedia for verifiability reasons, but it still raises NPOV concerns when certain editors try to force obscure research into the forefront of an article. You are mistaking a standard of verifiability (which is the standard for how to write an article) with editorial judgement: they need not be one-in-the-same. In other words, one need not &quot;verify&quot; that there is NPOV issues because, as editors, our editorial opinions do not need to be (nor can they be) verified. The only thing that needs to be verifiable is the text of the article. We are allowed to have judgements that are external to this. As such, it is perfectly reasonable to say that there are NPOV problems with someone citing a single, isolated, though published research paper. In terms of your dark matter red herring, you have totally misconstrued the situation, and I'm fairly confident that nearly any third party not firmly ensconced in pathological skepticism toward mainstream astrophysics would find your evaluation predictably myopic. Clowe's triumphalist attitude is only justified from the standpoint of [[standing on the shoulders of giants]]. It's not like he was publishing his &quot;proof&quot; of dark matter in a vacuum -- it was a particular point that was addressed to a particular (MOND-type) objection. However, when your hypothetical John Doe bucks the established research by publishing proof against dark matter, he is publishing in a vacuum. Prof. John Doe's work is marginal and therefore marginalized by Wikipedia. Clowe's work is mainstream and therefore reported by Wikipedia. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:47, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
::::::::SA is quite right about verifiability vs. editorial judgement.  However, I have to say I worry when editorial judgement of this type comes into dispute.  Wikipedia needs sources for two reasons: one is to have attributions in the articles, but another reason is that it levels the playing field in editorial discussions.  Inherently, experts on Wikipedia are not set above ordinary editors, but they may be more familiar with the subject in question.  But experts have to prove themselves, just like anyone else.  Fundamentally, Wikipedia is a community of equal editors.  So, this is a good argument ''for'' [[WP:SCIENCE]]: in order to avoid having to rely on editorial judgement too heavily, we look for a higher standard of quality in sources for scientific topics, and where that doesn't exist, we should avoid covering the subject.

:::::::::*Let's not mix up NPOV and editorial judgment. As I said earlier, the statement in the introduction is incorrect concerning NPOV. I also said it may concern notability, so I'm not dismissing the point. But let's be accurate as editors.
:::::::::*The idea that a community has informal discussions which a particular editor may be aware, is worthless. It is not verifiable, nor attributable. 
:::::::::*I know THREE different communities, all of whom have informal discussions, and promise peer reviewed papers that I could mention too. Also worthless.
:::::::::*An encyclopedia does not run on material gleaned from Chinese whispers via anonymous, unaccountable editors.
:::::::::*I had previously brought this up at the Neutrality Project, see &quot;[[Wikipedia_talk:Neutrality_Project#NPOV_misunderstanding|NPOV misunderstanding]]&quot;. They agree. A singular POV can be described in an NPOV manner. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 16:01, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

NPOV is inherently based in editorial judgement. The only way that someone determines whether there is a problem with NPOV is by making an editorial judgement. That's why the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{POV}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag comes with the wording it does. Disputes arise between editors over NPOV: if there was a singular editor there would never be NPOV issues from the standpoint of writing an article. While I agree with Mangojuice that editors are judged external to their status as &quot;experts&quot; (see ongoing conflicts over [[WP:EXPERT]] for example), the community doesn't deny the existence of experts either. No one is saying that the encyclopedia should be &quot;run&quot; on expert judgement or the whispers of whatever anonymous and unaccountable ethnic group, but people are saying that editors may come to the table with these concerns. That's the essence of the NPOV guideline: all the points-of-view are placed on the table and the marginalization happens per the outside community and references to the outside world. No one is saying that a singular POV cannot be described, but people are saying that singular POVs present unique difficulties when writing an encyclopedia that is supposed to be NPOV. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 17:39, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

:*Indeed, all the POVs are placed on the table. And if there is just one POV (because there is one WP:V/WP:RS/WP:A), then we can still write that POV so that it conforms to NPOV, regardless of whether you or I or anyone else agrees with the POV, and regardless of whether it is mainstream of pseudoscience.
:*In which case, the statement in the third paragraph that I described above, is incorrect. A view from a single researcher may fail a criteria, but there is no reason for it to fail NPOV; and if it does, any decent editor can re-write it so that it conforms to NPOV. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 19:19, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
:::If there is only one notable POV, then sure, we write about it. In which case the statement in the third paragraph is correct. A view from a single research written about on Wikipedia does have editorial issues related to NPOV for the reasons delineated because the alternatives may exist but cannot be included without falling into original research. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 19:23, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
::::*The statement is incorrect because a single POV does not fail NPOV unless it is written badly, in which case any competent editor can correct it. Sure, the statement may be allowed because it is notable. But it won't fail because of NPOV.
::::*A single POV that has been published elsewhere does not not fail &quot;Original research&quot;, because [[WP:NOR]] &quot;refers to '''unpublished''' facts&quot;. (my emphasis) --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 19:51, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

You are missing the point. Perhaps I should post here the statement that you dispute:

:''Research published in a reputable publication passes these thresholds but reflects the point of view of one researcher or research term and, unless it generates a significant outside response by the scientific community or the population at large, focusing on such research in a Wikipedia article does not adequately conform to [[WP:NPOV|Wikipedia's policy on neutrality]], in particular the section on [[WP:NPOV#Undue weight|undue weight]].''

You'll note that the point being made is that simply quoting published work is not good enough. Why isn't it good enough? Because unless the work in question has generated discussion it has not been vetted outside of Wikipedia to make it possible to write an article on the subject that adheres to the spirit and letter of NPOV.
--[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 20:36, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
::The POV of a single researcher in a single first-rate peer-reviewed publication, has normally been assessed by 2 or usually 3 independent scientists with a tendency to be ciritical. The assumption made by colleagues it that such results are correct unless proven otherwise. Are we supposed to be more critical of physics that he physicists who review for PRL? Then, if discussed by independent sources, as most scientific papers are, it is considered worth citing and commenting one. Reputable journals expect items listed as references to be relevant to the new work also. I'm a librarian. i think many articles in most library journals are basically trivial if not junk altogether.. But they are considered valuable by my colleagues in general, and its their trms that matter. I will judge by reporting theirs',  not imposing my own.'''[[User:DGG|DGG]]''' 09:02, 9 April 2007 (UTC)

:The statement which I quoted above, is as follows:
::&quot;the point of view of one researcher or research term and, unless it generates a significant outside response by the scientific community or the population at large, fails NPOV&quot;
:A single POV may fail, or being accepted by some other criteria. But a single POV does not fail NPOV (unless an editor writes poorly). 
:*To suggest that a statement based on a single POV, changes it's NPOV standing, depending on some other ''potential'' discussion whose view is yet to be determined, is illogical. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 20:46, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

If your point is that someone can attribute a single point of view in a fashion that is NPOV, that is absolutely correct. However, not every attributable point can be written about in a neutral fashion. An example of a quote that may be non-neutral though properly attributed and sourced is given at [[WP:FRINGE#Sourcing and attribution]]. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 00:01, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

:*Since describing a single POV can be achieved in an NPOV fashion, then the description in the third paragraph is incorrect which says that a single POV without response fails NPOV.
:*Judging/assessing a single POV is another matter altogether. But just because there may be no attributable assessments, does not make the description of a single POV automatically fail NPOV. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 00:34, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

I do not agree with the demand that not only must something be said in a respected peer reviewed journal, but that we must wait for other independent researchers to chime in, in OTHER respected peer reviewed journals, and agree with the first researcher that the claim is valid. The first post would constitute a reliable source satisfying [[WP:ATT]] and would be usable in a Wikipedia article. Similarly a book from a respected publisher would constitute a reliable source, without waiting for some other authority to write another book that says &quot;I agree with the first book.&quot; The demand places the bar way too high. It may be years before someone completely independent of the first researcher publishes the demanded blessing of the first researcher's claim. [[User:Edison|Edison]] 20:20, 9 April 2007 (UTC)

==[[Schmidt Sting Pain Index]]==
Can some of you knowledgable and discerning scientist Wikipedians take a look at this please? This article has currently been getting some coverage in popular &quot;gee whiz funny link of the day... how goofy!&quot; type blogs ( I hate it when this happens and the article in question is dubious... I think it gives a bad impression of wikipedia), but it seems to be mainly based on the idea that this one insect scientist guy wrote some goofy comments for an insect sting pain index one day. Ok, I agree that insect scientists are allowed to have senses of humour (WITHIN LIMITS, for the sake of us all), but I am concerned that 1) this scale is not really widespread and may be just one scale promoted by one guy without much acceptance in the insect expert community. 2) the pdf article linked which this wikipedia entry seems to be based on does not seem to say that Schmidt actually wrote those goofy comments. Its a bit ambiguous, but its seems to say that &quot;the media&quot; (without specifying what media) came up with the goofy comments to append to Schmidt's original dry scale(I think this may be another case where people exaggerate or misinterpret what an article is saying). I dont have any access to science journal databases, and am certainly no science or insect expert. But these concerns and quick scans of google books and google scholar led me to bring this issue to wiser heads. Thanks very much  for checking this out.

The index also has been mentioned in popular science pubs; though it doesn't appear to be taken seriously by scientists.  A scientifically-based pain index would be interesting (though I decline any offers to participate in such research); both this and the related Starr index appear to be little more than the opinions of the bug guys in question.  The article certainly dances on the edge of notability.  --[[User:EngineerScotty|EngineerScotty]] 05:30, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

******Ok, once again, in case anyone can actually respond on my point: the list of criteria here seems to be a misguided attempt to define reasons for notability that no one brings up in debates.  If the issue was the over-''deletion'' of science articles, having these criteria would make sense.  But it seems to me that the main thrust of this proposal is in the opposite direction.  These are just fodder for disagreement (see [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sorce theory]] for instance) and distract from the main point about the POV and OR issues involved in using only sources from a single author.

********Good: a direct response.  Two brief points: (1) Arbcom never asked for criteria, but they did encourage developing a guideline, which is different.  (2) The EU deletion debate looks very different to me - there, the argument was done from first principles and it worked very nicely, and it skirted around the edge of these criteria (no one ever talked about whether the EU concept was &quot;textbook science&quot; or had institutional support)... and as for extended discussions with Iantresman... I don't think the criteria will make one bit of difference, and that's not a very good reason anyway.  Long-winded debate... I don't think we should seek to avoid it as a general principle, debate is a good thing.  Criteria would simplify the job but scientific topics aren't exactly overwhelming the AfD lists.

== General notability guideline template ==
Since the general notability guideline is central to most sub-pages, someone came up with the idea of creating a centralized template which will be consistent among the permutations from WP:N.  Please see whether we can make this work here.  The text is meant to be fairly generic, but it may make sense to add text following the template for fine tuning, or help us to make the template more applicable if it is not reflecting the consensus for notability.  I certainly didn't get everything that I wanted, but I'm very happy to see the compromises that make this a fairly representive of the attitude of the project.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 01:12, 7 April 2007 (UTC)

==Merging [[Wikipedia:Notability (numbers)]]==
What are the thoughts on merging [[Wikipedia:Notability (numbers)]] into this guideline proposal?  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 19:15, 25 April 2007 (UTC)

I've added a brief section which is the meat from the numbers guideline.  This seems appropriately and neatly combined here.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 16:29, 15 May 2007 (UTC)
*It's a bad idea, as explained on the talk page of WP:NUM.

== Scope creep ==

I may be beating a dead horse here, but all the references to NPOV, proponents and advocacy make it seem like this is about pseudoscience/fringe science, and the discussion above seems to confirm it. As it tries to apply to specialised but uncontroversial science, not much of it bears any resemblance to reality. --[[User:Abu-Fool Danyal ibn Amir al-Makhiri|Abu-Fool Danyal ibn Amir al-Makhiri]] 02:29, 6 June 2007 (UTC)

== Proposal concerns (LV) ==
Note that I came here from a couple of AfDs which were trying to present this as policy criteria for an article's deleltion.  As I read down the line, I encountered several problems with the proposed guideline.  I apologize if any and all of the below have been covered in the Talk Archives, which I am not going to read now.

Problems that I have at present with the proposal:

*Introduction:
:* &quot;A topic that is acceptable under this guideline is an appropriate part of Wikipedia.&quot;
::Pretty sweeping blanket statement, to me.  No other Notability criteria I'm aware of suggests that &quot;if it passes this, it's in.&quot;  Indeed, it seems to violate the principle of a Guideline to me, which always limits itself to allow potential exceptions.  Further, each section usually defines which criteria are primary and which are secondary.
*Notability of topics related to science:
:*&quot;Decisions about including or excluding material must always reflect the opinions of outside authorities, not those of Wikipedia editors.&quot;
::I know this has been mentioned above, but I want to echo this concern:  Decisions about including or excluding material must always reflect the consensus of the Wikipedia editors.  Anything else beyond that is helpful clarification, or it becomes fodder for people to [[WP:IAR]].
::I'd feel much more comfortable with something like, ''&quot;Deicions about including or excluding material on a scientific basis ought to be supported by the opinions and stated facts of outside authorities, as per [[WP:RS|Wikpedia:Reliable Sources]].&quot;''  Start throwing 'musts' around in anything but policy (perhaps only unbreakable/unmodifiable policy) and you'll get a lot of irate editors, scientific or not.
:*&quot;Although publication creates verifiability and reputable journals are reliable sources, publication by itself is not a sufficient (and sometimes not necessary) standard for encyclopedic notability. Unpublished research fails no original research and often lacks verifiability, so it is unacceptable by policy. Research published in a reputable publication passes these thresholds but reflects the point of view of one researcher or research term and, unless it generates a significant outside response by the scientific community or the population at large, focusing on such research in a Wikipedia article does not adequately conform to Wikipedia's policy on neutrality, in particular the section on undue weight. This guideline clarifies how the Wikipedia community has applied NPOV to articles on scientific topics. It does however not apply to the inclusion of scientific research as authorative sources within articles. The criterion for such sources is not that they are notable, but that they are reliable.&quot;
::Wha?  Could this be any more complex?  I actually had to diagram this paragraph out to understand it.  My hypothesis is most editors will not.  Can't you simply say it is normally necessary to follow the general notability guidelines with respect to neutral, multiple, independent, verifiabile, reliable sources?  And if you do that, what is the point of this whole section - I'm seriously not understanding how this adds anything to present guidelines.
* Criteria / General
:*&quot;1. Widely cited. Papers covering the topic have been widely1 commented on in academic writing within the topic's field.
::2. Outside notability. The topic is notable due to significant coverage in reliable sources outside of academic publications.&quot;  
::So we want articles only commented upon widely by multiple academic sources, which also are commented on outside academic sources?  Seems pretty wide, to me.
::Aside from that, I know I read somewhere that Wikipedia is not just a general encyclopedia, but can cover articles appropriate to special subject encyclopedias as well.  Thus 2. might well fail, as most specialist encyclopedias I am aware of have many articles which would only be known inside the discipline the encyclopedia represents.
:*&quot;Notable topics which are primarily non-scientific... [etc.]&quot;
::Boy, I'm going to love the AfDs which try to define whether a topic is &quot;science&quot; or not trying to use this.  Not to mention the arguments you'll get whether or not cosmology (for example) has a scientific basis or not.  Not to mention you're setting up a criteria which is so subjective it will rarely-if-ever be able to objectively define where this guideline would be relevant or not.
::Also, you will get editors asking whether the guideline itself applies or not - something I don't think I've ever seen with any of the other specialty N's about the guideline ''itself''.  I don't need to know if Burpa-Cola has been covered in the Cola News and CNN, or if Billy Bob Arthbutnott has both parlimentary opinions as well as the Sun documenting his career to know that Corp or People:Politicians applies.
*Scientific terms
:Again, how does this get beyond neologisms in a way that Avoid Neologisms doesn't, aside from adding the words &quot;scientific literature&quot;?
*Numbers and Sources
:*&quot;1. Have professional mathematicians published papers on this topic?
::2. Is the sequence listed in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences? (In the case of sequences of rational numbers, does the OEIS have the sequences of numerators and denominators of the relevant fractions?)
::3. Do MathWorld and PlanetMath have articles on this topic?&quot;
:::This may be taken from WProj numbers, I don't know.  But are you stipulating that 2 and 3 are reliable sources? (The Sources section has exactly this same problem.  You're controlling what is considered a Reliable Source without allowing the Wikipedia community at large to define that.  I have a problem with that - if I were arguing Notability(Religion), I would not want it to say that the Bible is an authorized source and any other 'holy' texts by default would have to prove themselves.)
*Sources
:*&quot;Scientific discovery is often disconnected from public discourse, so standard methods of sourcing and verifying are not always applicable. A scientific topic which yields low hit counts in the Google test...&quot;
::That's nice.  The Google test is widely regarded as discredited anyway.  Yes, I know it's still used, but it's questionability is known.
::Also, verifying and sourcing is verfying and sourcing.  I believe what's being aimed at here is scientific notability may have a smaller and different base (with different types of sourcing) for inclusion than other forms of notability.  So why not say that?  Except that above you're demanding 'popular' coverage as well as academic.
:*&quot;Web (and library) searches should therefore be evaluated based on the quality rather than the quantity of the finds.&quot;
::Thus, you allow extreme subjectivity creep, unless you are going to make further instruction creep in what constitutes scientific quality.  (My Jung is better than your Freud.  My Hawking beats your Einstein.  My t test is better than your bean counting.)  Common sense might be able to dictate that, but science is full of periods of flying in the face of qualitative common sense and succeeding - because it's right.
:*&quot;The following is a list of sources with qualifications of their usefulness.&quot;
::Again, you're preaching what is and isn't acceptable as a source, without allowing the community consensus to decide this over time. 
:*&quot;Google, Yahoo.... [etc]&quot; 
::Uh, again, how is this any different from Google test?

Finally, may I invite you to consider that most notability guidelines are much less complex and much more tolerant of letting individual cases be decided as individual cases?  And I hope that the question about &quot;Have we reached consensus?&quot; is asking if you as the editors have reached consensus about what you want to present to the community as a whole, as opposed to &quot;Are we ready to make this policy ourselves?&quot;

It may seem like I'm pissing all over your proposal.  I hope it doesn't, because I'd like to see a Notability(Science) guideline.  But I want it to be one that's usable and used - I wouldn't do either with this, and I'd argue as need be when someone tries to use this as a vote justification (which will happen, whether you want it to or not.)  Sorry for the length of the diatribe.

The rejected tag is appropriate and should stand until there is adequate discussion here to demonstrate active interest in the proposal.

It looks like a number of the contributors here are no longer active at WP: Lantreman ws banned, BDJ and Science Appologist have quit, Minder Binder, Abu-Fool Danyal ibn Amir al-Makhiri, and Laughing Vulcan have not contributed substantially since June and at all since mid-July.   &lt;s&gt;Trials and Errors and Radiant are advocating reinstating this as a proposal&lt;/s&gt;, but I don't think that there are enough editors who see this as a need.

* What I see now is something that is so watered down and nebulous that it cannot act as a genuine policy.  If people want to revive this effort, then we need to return to a version like [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Notability_%28science%29&amp;oldid=117329647 this one] and work from there.  IMO, what happenned to this effort is that a number of people whose pet articles were running afoul of this proposed policy chose to get involved with the blatant intent to sabotage it and remove its impact on their work, and unfortunately succeeded in doing so.&lt;br&gt;IMO, there is a genuine need for a policy like this to clarify what &quot;notability&quot; and &quot;verifiability&quot; mean in the context of a science article, and how [[WP:UNDUE]] should be applied.  It may be that this is an issue that is best handled by the admins with the advice and consent of the community so that we can avoid the pitfalls of the past. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:49, 20 August 2007 (UTC)
*I see, if not frequent, so at least [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere/Wikipedia:Notability_%28science%29&amp;limit=500&amp;from=0 recurrent use] of this guideline/proposed guideline/essay, very much in keeping with the rather low number of science-related AfD discussions. Absence of discussion on the talk page certainly doesn't establish rejection. I agree with EMS that the two-item version is watered down beyond recognition of the original version, and I don't see any consensus for it. ~ [[User:Trialsanderrors|trialsanderrors]] 16:07, 20 August 2007 (UTC)
:: Per [[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines]]: ''&quot;A rejected page is any proposal for which consensus support is not present, regardless of whether there is active discussion or not. Consensus need not be fully opposed; if consensus is neutral on the issue and unlikely to improve, the proposal is likewise rejected. It is considered bad form to hide this fact, e.g. by removing the tag. Making small changes will not change this fact, nor will repetitive arguments. Generally it is wiser to rewrite a rejected proposal from scratch and start in a different direction.&quot;'' --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 16:14, 20 August 2007 (UTC)

::: It seems to me that a lot of work has gone into turning this into something that everyone can reject.

== Reverted to earlier version ==

I have reverted the article to the form of lat March, with some twaking of the lead and the first section.  The revised first section now has a simple first paragraph that states the need to this policy as succinctly as I can.  The next two paragraphs have had their order exchanged so that the farily dry &quot;relevance&quot; paragraph comes last.  The previous last paragraph has been removed as an unreadable mess.  (I believe I drafted that paragraph originally, but it really never worked as intended, and only got worse over time.)

The {{tl|rejected}} tag has been kept as a matter of form, with the {{tl|proposed}} tag just commented out but still present.  I for one would be happy to see this version go back to &quot;proposed&quot; status, but I want to see if others are on-board for doing that.  Let's just say that after having taken a rest, I am ready and willing to work towards acceptance of a functional version of this as a policy or guideline if others are. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 18:24, 20 August 2007 (UTC)

:Personally, I don't see a lot of point reviving this.  The criteria have always been an attempt to change practice rather than an attempt to document practice, and to most people, the criteria and the proposal are one and the same.  The criteria really haven't caught on, and from my experience, people rely on other policies for scientific topics, like [[WP:OR]] and [[WP:V]], and where notability is needed, the general [[WP:N]] seems to be sufficient and its use is accepted.

:: Having looked more closely at the edit history, I find that your attempt to streamline this two two items has met fairly stiff resistance.  Then again, that is little wonder since your proposed consolidation ends up being little more than a restatement of pre-existing policy.  The goal of this proposal is to set up guidelines that go beyond the current policies and which are adapted to the issues which are unique to science.  Wikiepdia has very much outgrown [[WP:NOR|&quot;No original research&quot;]] and the requirement to use [[peer review]]ed [[scientific journal|journals]].  What do you do with a source that is &quot;peer reviewed&quot; but where the peers are fellow followers of a [[fringe science|fringe theory]]?  What do you do about the use of [[Nature (journal)|Nature magazine]], which is highly respected but does not use peer review to help select its articles?  What do you make of a theory published in a respected scientific journals but on which noone has cared to comment except the author?  What do you do with the [[cold fusion]] controversy created by Pons and Fleishman back in 1987 which obviously is notable within science but which was never respected by it?  There will not be many of these to contend with, but when they do appear this guideline will be invaluable.
:::::Please excuse my comment here, but the article content of Nature is peer reviewed. Like some other journals, it has on rare occasions published things based on consensus of the key editors, without formal peer review. The news content is not, of course, just editorially prepared -- by the most careful people around. It was they who caught the similarity of the stem cell photos after the peer reviewers missed it.

:: You like to cite [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sorce theory]] as a place where this guideline did not work.  For that I solidly disagree.  That article's creator had to play all kinds of games with these criteria to make a case for keeping the article.  In the end, his attempts to make the article look acceptable only helped to do it in.  In context this is a farly powerful tool.  In addition, it is not going to do in fringe science articles.  For example, I helped by have an aritcle on a book by [[Halton Arp]] kept because it was noted within the field of astronomy and also gained some measure of attention from the public at large.  That press coverage (both scientific and popular) could establish notability as described here was helpful in that discussion. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 01:03, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

:::You might note that my reduction to two criteria stood for over two months without comment.  You may also note that coverage by press and by scientific sources were the criteria I left in place, since those are the only part of the criteria that are useful.  What I object to are the other criteria, like &quot;textbook science&quot; or &quot;popular belief&quot; that are redundant and provide loopholes for argumentative POV pushers.  Can you hypothesize an example where a topic is &quot;textbook science&quot; or has a &quot;prominent advocate&quot; or has &quot;institutional support&quot; where the topic would be acceptable for Wikipedia ''without'' significant coverage in independent, reliable sources, academic or otherwise?

::::I am not sure whether I agree with you or not. I certainly think that there are science articles that are best referenced by standard textbooks, particularly for articles that are at the level of high school or early university science. For example, we probably do not want to source a peer reviewed journal on [[density]] and we do not. Are textbooks reliable sources? If so we do not need to mention &quot;textbook science&quot;, but if they are not, we probable do. --[[User:Bduke|Bduke]] 03:09, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

::::::: As for the other criteria: you agree on 3 and 4.  6 is totally pointless, because none of the criteria would expire once met.  7 obviously must require sourcing to back it up or it's totally vacuous and anyone could claim it about anything.  And anything discussed in a legitimate textbook is already covered in a reliable source, and I highly doubt that we'd ever find a case where one textbook mentions a topic but absolutely no other sources do.  Yeah, I agree, if we pare it any further, the ''criteria'' say nothing more than [[WP:N]] does.. so maybe we should lose the criteria altogether, or just spend more time explaining the issues that arise in assessing the quality of sources, especially academic ones.

(unindent) I think that you have just made an excellent suggestions in calling for an explanation of how to assess the reliability and relevance of sources.  Given some of the issues I have had recently with the anti-relativists over at [[talk:Herbert Dingle]], this makes a lot of sense.  (In those discussions, at least one person would take anything that he could find from a &quot;peer reviewed journal&quot; as evidence of a conflict over relativity and the [[twin paradox]].  Said contributions come from almost unknown overseas journals and in another case a blatantly anti-relativity publisher.)  I would still keep the remaining criteria as a way of saying that those things are the primary hallmarks of scientific notability, while noting that other options for notability are not prohibited. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:20, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

:I believe that's better, but I still think we should remove the criteria.  The problem is, people always seem to conflate a notability guideline and its criteria, while all other text is ignored.  By not having criteria, we would force people to read the discussion about the reliability of scientific sources.  (Actually, come to think about it, &quot;Notability (science)&quot; may not be the best name.  What about &quot;Reliable sources (scientific)&quot;?)

:: The criteria don't exist for the benefit of those that would abuse them but instead for the benefit of those that are looking for good guidance on what is acceptable.  The creator of an article will invariably try to defend it against an AfD.  IMO, if the article's creator can make a case that their article is acceptable under this criteria and everyone agrees, then these criteria have done a service in helping people to make that decision.  Similarly, if people listen to the creator's case and conclude that it does not hold water, then the criteria will also have helped by focussing the debate on the relevant issues and helping to bring about the deletion.  So as I see it these criteria overall are helpful.  Besides, it really is in the absense of clear guidelines that you get the nastiest debates. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 19:01, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

(a) Notability, (b) reliability of a source, and (b) reliable of the facts in that source, are all quite different, and tell us how to describe information, not whether to include it. If Arp publishes some information in an obscure overseas publications, and Stephen Hawkins in in Nature, Arp's supporters will find his article more notable, and no less reliable. And if Hawkins is described in a textbook, then it tells us that his ideas have a wider readership, and neither are as popular as today's astrology column.  &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment was added by [[Special:Contributions/{{{IP|{{{User|84.244.165.174}}}}}}|{{{IP|{{{User|84.244.165.174}}}}}}]] ([[User talk:{{{IP|{{{User|84.244.165.174}}}}}}|talk]]) {{{Time|17:34, August 21, 2007 (UTC)}}}&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Abandon this as an unnecessary complication==

Whether a peer review journal, a textbook, a popular book, a university hosted website or a notable persons personal site  is sufficiently reliable, reputable, or secondary is probably best treated on a case by case basis, and in any case this is not a problem specific to science.

Are there any controversial articles that are better treated by Notability (science) than by WP:NOR, WPV, and WP:N?  I think not.  I think there are too many guidelines, especially where they overlap.  True science should only need to satisfy WP:NOR and WP:V.  Where the subject is not true science, or is borderline, a further test should be simply whether others have written about it.  WP:N provides this test.  A lot of work has been invested in this project page, but that is not sufficient reason to adopt it.  It is rule creep, and it does damage by obfuscating more important policies and guidelines.

There seems to be tendency here for some to want a guideline to provide a science-quality test.  This is not an encyclopaedia’s role.  The ascribing of “Finge science”, “pseudo science” or “lunacy” to any theory is a job for third party sources, not for wikipedia rules.  

EMS suggests that some nasty debates exist because of the weakness of this guideline.  Some elaboration would be nice.  Discussion above suggests to me that the relativity article needs work, not that wikipedia needs more rules.

This project page should be abandoned.  Science is well covered by WP:OR and WP:V, and where notability is needed, the general WP:N seems to be sufficient and its use is accepted. --[[User:SmokeyJoe|SmokeyJoe]] 02:08, 22 August 2007 (UTC)

It’s always about sourcing, specifically whether the sources are sufficiently independent, sufficiently secondary, sufficiently reputable (not a blog or similar), or covers the subject in sufficient depth.  These are all straight WP:N issues, deriving directly from a combination of WP:NOR and WP:V.  There is plenty of evidence of spirited debate in places about the science of the content involved, and this sometimes is uncivil, but such spirited debate seems to me to be irrelevant to the debates, and always a symptom of editors who are too far into OR editing and are not looking at the subject objectively.  This is why Notability (science) may do more harm than good.  It suggests that there is something special about science.  The criteria for inclusion in wikipedia do not depend upon the science.

==physics? i think not==
do not confuse the observer effect with the uncertainty principle. the uncertainty principle has nothing to do with &quot;observing&quot;, it has to do with measuring. the observer effect is a supposed effect of observing an event and the influence of your presence on the event. no one would ever have to actually observe a particle's position to obfuscate its momentum, the mere act of using the photons to measure its position, even if nobody ever observed it, would suffice.

-------------
don't you have to observe in order to measure?
-------------

Indeed.  But what does measuring have to do with Quantum Mechanics exactly?  

To measure is to observe the results of a measurement process [that ascertains the subject measurement].  Humans observe with their senses — the senses that humans have.  Other conscious beings, perhaps including computers, may have other senses with which they can implement tools for making measurements.  At the end of the day, measuring ''ALWAYS'' involves observing.  

Tools used by beings to make measurements are limited (in their accuracy) by various factors including the limitations of ones senses.  The often-mentioned example of bouncing a photon off of an atom to measure its position illustrates the problem with knowing the position ''AND'' momentum of ''THAT'' atom at the ''SAME MOMENT'' in time.  The concept usually centers on the fact that the position measurement photon will change the momentum of the subject atom.  But aren't there other aspects of this problem?  

In the limit (considering the non-zero mass of the atom and the non-zero energy of the photon), can one ever know perfectly even the position alone?  Perhaps so, since the mechanical inertance of the atom precludes its reaction at ''THAT'' infinitesimal instant in time.  

Why is not ''THIS'' example an instance of &quot;observer effect&quot; rather than the uncertainty principle, per se?  If one seeks only to measure the position alone, then maybe it is neither.  Then again, is it not &quot;Observer Effect&quot; even if the momentum is changed by measuring only the position?  One would think so.  

Well, what if we start with measuring the momentum &quot;first&quot;?  How does one measure momentum, anyway?  Again, we observers devise a measurement process that allows our senses to detect the &quot;answer.&quot;  Momentum is mass times velocity.  If we know the mass, we might then seek to measure the velocity.  Human observers tend to ascertain velocity by measuring position at two points in time.  For non-zero velocities, this means two different points in space, of course.  Yet, [instantaneous] velocity is ''DEFINED'' at only one point in space and time.  Thus, one cannot measure velocity (or momentum) in this manner: one must ''WAIT'' to ''SEE'' how fast it is moving, and this yields only an average (not instantaneous) value.  

Before continuing on to propose measuring momentum, per se, by some other means (say, smashing the atom into an obstacle at a known position), we should note that the Uncertainty Principle pertains only to Quantum Mechanics.  In ''THAT'' world, particles are not particles; rather, they are probability density functions.  The interpretation of this ''MODEL'' of a particle says the position and momentum of the subject particle are INHERENTLY uncertain by virtue of the mathematical model itself.  To precisely derive the position, one must manipulate the model in a manner that causes the momentum &quot;to drop out of the formula,&quot; and vice versa.  

The relationship between position and momentum described by Quantum Mechanics is somewhat like the relationship between the time domain and the frequency domain described by the Fourier Transform.  One can say that there is some similarity as well between position and velocity in Classical Mechanics.  In fact, the description above with knowing the velocity versus position of the atom is exactly that: Classical Mechanics. 

Following this line of thinking, one (''such as this user who is not fluent in the intricate semantics of Quantum Theory'') might be likely to reach these conclusions: 
 

'''1. Using &quot;particulate&quot; atoms and photons to describe the Uncertainty Principle of Quantum Mechanics is ''flat wrong''.''' 

'''2. One does not observe Quantum Mechanics.  Rather, one uses that theory to make calculations to explain the observations of certain experiments.'''

'''3. Measurements ''ALWAYS'' involve observations and therefore also ''ALWAYS'' involve the Observer Effect.  Perhaps this ''IS'' the “Theory of the Observer Effect.”'''

'''4. The Uncertainty Principle of Quantum Mechanics and the Observer Effect are ''fundamentally'' unrelated.'''  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:JimRodgers|JimRodgers]] ([[User talk:JimRodgers|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/JimRodgers|contribs]]) 12:54, 31 July 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

For some reason this article is more focused on what the observer effect is not. --[[User:Nathanael Bar-Aur L.|Nathanael Bar-Aur L.]] 20:09, 10 April 2007 (UTC)

From what I understood from other sources, the observer effect is basically the collapsing of a quantum system's wavefunction that happens the moment a measurement in made upon it (by an &quot;observer&quot;), therefore cancelling any superposition that may have existed beforehand, and giving specific definition to the renderings. Is this correct? --[[User:Nathanael Bar-Aur L.|Nathanael Bar-Aur L.]] 20:21, 10 April 2007 (UTC)

==Suggestions==
Current article states &quot;not that of the driveshaft, along the axis of the car&quot;.
Add a paragraph that illustrates this with the driveshaft of the front-engine, rear-wheel-drive Porsche 928.
Also industrial examples and diagrams from mechanical engineering and classical mechanics.
e.g. a torque tube to allign parts of a hinge operated by two hydraulic cylinders.&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/206.188.57.60|206.188.57.60]] ([[User talk:206.188.57.60|talk]]) 14:42, 30 October 2006 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;

== Diagrams ==
Can anyone find a picture of this? I'm having a very hard time picturing what this would look like...[[User:70.157.134.125|70.157.134.125]] 01:01, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

==Accuracy==
This page is not really accurate. Cars like the STS, Corvette, etc. have independent rear suspensions, and the torque tube is not used to transmit acceleration forces in these vehicles. Rather, it is because they have trans-axles in the rear of the car and it connects the trans-axle with the engine in the front. However, I am not enough of an expert on the subject to write a clear and well-written clarification so I have just added some templates to the top of the page. --[[User:Ozziegt|Ozziegt]] ([[User talk:Ozziegt|talk]]) 21:33, 1 July 2009 (UTC)

:Corvette since at least 1988 doesn't have a torque tube (unless they put one in later), and apart from the Miata I'm hard pushed to think of an IRS that uses one. I agree, this article is pretty horrid, it needs a rewrite rather than refs. [[User:Greglocock|Greglocock]] ([[User talk:Greglocock|talk]]) 11:13, 2 July 2009 (UTC)

:Corvettes since the late 90's do indeed have torque tubes, of the same type that the Porsche 924/944/928 etc use.  All the mentioned Porsches are IRS and use a torque tube.  Part of the probem with this article is that it lumps very diverse systems together;  the early Ford systems are completely different from the Corvette/Porsche systems.  Both are classified as torque tubes, but the article does not focus on the essence of a TT, which is the use of a smaller torque-transmitting element inside a carrier. The carrier may or may not be static and may or may not be carrying driveline forces (like the Fords). [[User:52FordF-1|52FordF-1]] ([[User talk:52FordF-1|talk]]) 15:44, 18 July 2009 (UTC)

::Yup my bad, 2005 Corvette (as a random example) uses a transaxle and a torque tube. Note that the Corvette system is different to the Peugoet one, as the latter includes an articulating joint at the front whereas the Corvette system does not. This is a big deal, to a driveline engineer at least.[[User:Greglocock|Greglocock]] ([[User talk:Greglocock|talk]]) 23:25, 18 July 2009 (UTC)

:Agreed. The article as written is essentially BS. A torque tube fundamentally counteracts the torque of the driveshaft; the alternative is that the torque is counteracted by the torsional rigidity of the frame (the net torque must, obviously, be zero otherwise the rear of the car would rotate). The torque tube often does transfer forward wheel force to the front of the car, but this is not inherent in the mere fact of having a torque tube: there must still be a mechanism locating the wheels longitudinally relative to the diff/transaxle. This is analogous to the usual need to locate the wheels relative to the frame (most simply, with leaf springs) in order to move the car forward.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/110.175.57.184|110.175.57.184]] ([[User talk:110.175.57.184|talk]]) 05:05, 18 March 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== simple definition? ==

It has been my understanding from looking through service manuals and talking to mechanics that the corvette style torque tubes are just an enclosed driveshaft that connects a front mounted engine to the rear mounted transmission (with fully independent rear suspension)

I guess it's not simply called a 'driveshaft' in a classical sense since it doesn't connect a front mounted transmission to the rear differential  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/184.57.87.173|184.57.87.173]] ([[User talk:184.57.87.173|talk]]) 20:38, 15 August 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</text>

'''''Hello!'''''

Thanks for uploading some pictures to Wikipedia.  I wanted to make sure you were aware of some of the requirements and good practices for uploaded images.

*'''Pick an image name.'''
:When [[Special:Upload|uploading]] an image, pick a file name that is descriptive, and unique.  Remember that many images may be uploaded about the same topic, and remember that names are case sensitive.

*'''Source the image.'''
:On the [[Help:Image page|image description page]], explain where the image came from.  If you created the image yourself, then say so.  If it's from the web, give a URL.  If it's a screenshot of a movie or game, or a scan from a book, give the title.

*'''Provide copyright and license information.'''
:This part is a little bit trickier, but it's very important.  The copyright of the image generally belongs to whomever created it.
::''If it's a photograph you took, or an image you created'' (modifying an image that already exists doesn't count) in software like [[Photoshop]] or [[GIMP]], then you own the copyright.  To upload it to Wikipedia, you must agree to license it under the [[GFDL]] (which allows anyone to use it, but requires that they give credit to the original author and requires that any further edit to the image be licensed under the GFDL as well) or release it into the [[public domain]] (which allows anyone to use it for any purpose without restriction.)  Do this by placing an appropriate [[WP:ICT|tag]] on the [[Wikipedia:image description page|image description page]], like &amp;#123;{[[Template:GFDL|GFDL]]}} or &amp;#123;{[[Template:PD|PD]]}}.  Be sure to mention that you created the image.  If you're using &amp;#123;{[[Template:PD|PD]]}}, you may also want to use &amp;#123;{[[Template:NoRightsReserved|NoRightsReserved]]}}, since there is some dispute as to whether one may grant items into the public domain.
::''If you didn't create the image,'' or the copyright somehow belongs to another party (like a screenshot, which you might &quot;create&quot;, but the copyright belongs to the author of the movie or video game), then you need to find another [[WP:ICT|tag]] that describes the copyright status of the image.  Images used on Wikipedia need to be free for our use and the use of [[WP:FORKS|sites]] which reproduce our content.  This means that images cannot have a restriction such as &quot;only for use by Wikipedia&quot;, or &quot;for non-commercial use only&quot;, or &quot;for educational use&quot;.  Images without a free license may be usable in certain articles under [[WP:FU|fair use]], but such a use should be justified on the image description page.

*'''Describe the image.'''
:To another reader, the image may not be immediately understood.  A caption in an article doesn't explain the image to a visitor who sees it on its image page.  Put a brief explanation of what is in the image on the image description page, similar to what you might include in a caption on an article.  

Some links to Wikipedia pages on this subject: 

'''[[Wikipedia:Copyrights#Image guidelines|Copyrights]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags|Copyright tags]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Fair use|Fair use]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Image description page|Image description page]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Granting work into the public domain|Public domain]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion|Images for deletion]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Possibly unfree images|Possibly unfree images]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Copyright problems|Copyright problems]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Uploading images|Uploading images]]'''

Thanks again for your contributions.  If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me at my talk page. [[User:Feydey|feydey]] 19:42, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

An '''anti-submarine missile'''  is a [[standoff missile|standoff]] [[anti-submarine weapon]]. Often a variant of [[anti-ship missile]] designs an anti-submarine systems typically use a [[jet engine|jet]] or [[rocket engine|rocket]] engine, to deliver: an [[explosive material|explosive]] [[warhead]] aimed directly at a [[submarine]]; a [[depth charge]], or;  a homing [[torpedo]] that is carried from a launch ship, or other  platform, to the vicinity of a target.
[[File:Ikara missile.JPG|thumb|right|&lt;small&gt;[[Ikara (missile)|Ikara]], an [[Australia]]n-designed missile used by several navies between the 1960s and 1990s; a [[rocket engine|rocket]]-parachute delivery system carried an [[acoustic torpedo]] up to 10 nautical miles (19 km) after launch. A variant re-designed in the UK and used by the Royal Navy could deliver a [[Nuclear depth bomb|nuclear depth charge]].&lt;/small&gt;]]
[[File:Maille-Braize-14.jpg|thumb|&lt;small&gt;The [[Malafon]], used by the French Navy between 1966 and 1997, used a rocket-assisted glider to carry a torpedo up to 8 nautical miles (13 km) after launch&lt;/small&gt;. ]]

==History==
[[Depth charge]]s were the earliest weapons designed for use by ships against submerged [[submarine]]s. These explosives were initially dropped as the ship moved over the presumed location of a submarine. Before World War II, shipboard [[sonar]] was unable to maintain contact with a submarine at close range. 

Various [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]]-type projectors, including [[hedgehog (weapon)|hedgehog]] and [[squid (weapon)|squid]], were devised during [[World War II]] to allow a ship to maintain sonar contact while lobbing explosive charges toward the submarine.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Terry, and Costello, John ''The Battle of the Atlantic'' (1977) Dial Press {{Listed Invalid ISBN|0-8037-6454-2}} pp.307-308&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the [[Cold War]], [[missile]]s were developed to provide greater range with reduced [[recoil]]. Some missiles and rockets carry [[homing torpedo]]es to provide terminal guidance for the warhead.&lt;ref&gt;Albrecht, Gerhard ''Weyer's Warships of the World'' (1969) United States Naval Institute p.385&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''northern river shark''' or '''New Guinea river shark''' (''Glyphis garricki'') is a [[species]] of [[requiem shark]], in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Requiem shark|Carcharhinidae]] found in scattered [[tidal river]]s and associated coastal waters in northern [[Australia]] and in [[Papua New Guinea]]. This species inhabits areas with poor visibility, soft bottoms, and large [[tide]]s, with immature sharks ranging into [[freshwater|fresh]] and [[brackish water]]. It is similar to other river sharks in having a stocky grey body with a high back, tiny eyes, and broad fins. It measures up to {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} long.

Northern river sharks are likely [[piscivorous]]. This species is [[viviparous]], with females bearing litters of 9 young possibly every other year before the [[wet season]]. Very rare and facing threats from [[commercial fishing|commercial]] and [[recreational fishing]], and perhaps also [[habitat degradation]], this species has been assessed as [[Critically Endangered]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]].

==Taxonomy==
The first known specimens of the northern river shark, two newborn males from Papua New Guinea, were discovered by [[New Zealand]] [[ichthyologist]] [[Jack Garrick]], after whom the species was eventually  named. This shark was referred to as &quot;''Glyphis'' sp. C&quot; until 2008, when it was formally described by [[Leonard Compagno]], William White, and [[Peter R. Last]] in a [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] paper. The [[type specimen]] is a female {{convert|67|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, collected from the [[East Alligator River]], [[Kakadu National Park]], [[Northern Territory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Compagno, L.J.V. |author2=W.T.

==Distribution and habitat==
The northern river shark has been reported from [[King Sound]], the [[Ord River]], and Doctors Creek near [[Derby, Western Australia]], the [[Adelaide River|Adelaide]] and [[Alligator Rivers]] in Australia's [[Northern Territory]], and the [[Daru]] region and possibly the [[Fly River]] in Papua New Guinea. It inhabits large [[river]]s, [[estuaries]], and coastal [[bay]]s, all of which are characterized by high [[turbidity]], silty or muddy bottoms, and large tides. Young and juvenile sharks are found in fresh, brackish, and salt water ([[salinity]] ranging from 2 to 36 ppt), whereas adults have only been found in marine environments.&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pillans et al&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pillans, R.D. |author2=J.D.

==Description==
Like other members of its genus, the northern river shark has a stocky body with a high back. The head is wide and flattened, with a broadly rounded snout and minute eyes equipped with [[nictitating membrane]]s. Each [[nostril]] is divided into a very large incurrent opening and a small excurrent opening by a triangular skin flap. The sizable mouth is broadly arched, with short furrows at the corners. Thirty-one to 34 tooth rows are in the upper jaw and 30&amp;ndash;35 tooth rows are in the lower jaw; the upper teeth are upright and triangular with serrated edges, while the lower teeth are narrower and straight to slightly curved. In the largest individuals, the first few lower teeth from the jaw median are spear-shaped with serrations near the tip.&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;/&gt;

The [[pectoral fin]]s are large and broad, with gently backward-curving margins and pointed tips. The [[pelvic fin]]s are triangular with nearly straight trailing margins. The first [[dorsal fin]] is long-based and triangular, with the apex almost forming a right angle; the second dorsal fin is some two-thirds as high as the first. The origin of the first dorsal fin lies over the pectoral fin insertions, while that of second dorsal fin lies over the pelvic fin rear tips. No ridge exists between the dorsal fins. The [[anal fin]] is smaller than the second dorsal fin and has a strong notch in the rear margin. The [[caudal fin]] has a strong lower lobe and a long, narrow upper lobe with a ventral notch near the tip. The [[dermal denticle]]s are small, oval, and overlapping, bearing three horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth. This shark is steel-gray above and white below; the color transition is sharp, located well below the eye, and becomes jagged on the sides of the trunk. The anal and caudal fins become dusky or black towards the trailing margins and tips. The maximum known length is {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}}. This species differs from the [[speartooth shark]] (''G. glyphis'') in several [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] and [[meristic]] characters, including having fewer [[vertebra]]e (137&amp;ndash;151 versus 213&amp;ndash;222) and a lower, jagged gray-white color boundary.&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;/&gt;

==Biology and ecology==
With its slender teeth, small eyes, and high density of [[ampullae of Lorenzini]], the northern river shark seems to be [[adaptation|adapted]] for hunting [[fish]] in conditions of poor visibility. In Doctors Creek, sharks may move to and from favored feeding areas with the tide.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thorburn, D.C., D.L. Morgan, A.J. Rowland and H.S. Gill. (February 2004). [http://www.environment.gov.au/coasts/publications/pubs/glyphis-wa.pdf The northern river shark (''Glyphis'' sp. C) in Western Australia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108234623/http://environment.gov.au/coasts/publications/pubs/glyphis-wa.pdf |date=8 November 2011 }}. Report to the National Heritage Trust, Murdoch University. Retrieved on 10 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Like other requiem sharks, this species is [[viviparous]], with the developing [[embryo]]s forming a [[placenta]]l connection to their mother after exhausting their supply of [[yolk]]. Females give birth around October, before the start of the [[wet season]], on possibly a biennial cycle. One female examined contained nine [[fetus]]es.&lt;ref name=&quot;pillans et al&quot;/&gt; The young are born at under {{convert|67|cm|in|abbr=on}} long; males [[sexual maturity|mature]] between lengths of {{convert|1.2|and|1.4|m|ft|abbr=on}}, while females mature between lengths of {{convert|1.4|and|1.7|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;/&gt;

==Human interactions==
The northern river shark appears to be extremely rare, though more subpopulations may remain to be discovered in Australia and Papua New Guinea. Based on present information, no more than 250 mature individuals are estimated to exist in the wild, with no more than 50 in any particular subpopulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt; This species is caught legally and illegally by [[commercial fisheries]] using [[longline fishing|longlines]] and [[gillnet]]s, as well as by [[recreational fishing|recreational fishers]]; [[habitat degradation]] may pose a further threat to its survival. Because of its low natural abundance, limited distribution, stringent habitat requirements, and susceptibility to various human-caused threats, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] has assessed the northern river shark as [[critically endangered]]. It has also been listed as endangered on the 1999 Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, and on the 2000 Territory Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act. Kakadu National Park may be an important protected area for this species.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt; No regulations restrict the capture of this species in Papua New Guinea.&lt;ref name=&quot;white et al&quot;/&gt;

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Zoidberg. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Zoidberg~enwiki that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]]. If you think you might own all of the accounts with this name and this message is in error, please visit [[Special:MergeAccount]] to check and attach all of your accounts to prevent them from being renamed.

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== Hare Krishna picture ==

There is a picture of a Hare Krishna procession in the [[Religion_in_Mexico#Buddhism|Buddhism]] section, even with a caption about them being buddhists. Hare Krishnas are not buddhists, they are hindus. The article is semi-protected so I can not correct that myself. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Wenzelkarbovski|Wenzelkarbovski]] ([[User talk:Wenzelkarbovski|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Wenzelkarbovski|contribs]]) 17:39, 22 April 2015 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Self-ascription fallacy ==

''The last census reported, by self-ascription, that over 95% of the population is Christian.''

The so-called self-ascription of the census is nothing but a silly way of measuring data. Obviously they count children as Christians just because their parents say so. This people should either be clear about this or not count children at all. By the way, since a couple of years ago the Catholic Church has started to indoctrinate [[Huichol]] kids. Shame on us, Mexicans. Shame on us... The Huichols were one of the very few indigenous people whose religious tradition haven't been polluted by Catholicism but now the church has started taking advantage of the poverty of this people and the new constitutional reforms to infiltrate to their villages and improvise &quot;schools&quot;. Of course they know that adults wouldn't let themselves be indoctrinated so they choose to attack young minds. Catholicism and ignorance have been the ingredients of our condition as a Third World country.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Scandza|Scandza]] ([[User talk:Scandza|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Scandza|contribs]]) 13:27, 30 May 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;


Can anyone explain why the Evangelical Free Church of America does so many, many missionary trips to Mexico, when it's a predominantly catholic country? I mean, there are definite ideological differences involved, but I wasn't aware the two churches actively tried to convert each other's members.


==First phrase==

Any interest in removing &quot;Unlike some other Latin American countries&quot; from the first sentence of the article? It does not seem to serve any objective purpose and seems slightly antagonistic.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Namenderkrieg|Namenderkrieg]] ([[User talk:Namenderkrieg|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Namenderkrieg|contribs]]) 15:34, 24 March 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Easter==

I'm removing this:

&quot;Some of them however, do not celebrate Easter because they think that the Easter Bunny is the devil. Instead of celebrating Easter, they like to eat Mexican Pizzas.&quot;

because it's obviously untrue and just stupid. I think the article should be rewritten though, by someone more experienced than I am.--[[User:PARCGOP|PARCGOP]] 14:09, 7 April 2007 (UTC)

==Contradiction?==
This article says that 95% of people in Mexico are Roman Catholic.  The Mexico article states that 95% of people are Christian, and only 89% are Roman Catholic.  Which is correct, or am I just confused?
[[User:Yumecosmos|Yumecosmos]] ([[User talk:Yumecosmos|talk]]) 02:20, 9 January 2008 (UTC)

== Rewriting ==

I have imported the Religion section from the article on [[Mexico]] and integrated the information that was only on this article. I also moved around paragraphs and added a subtitle to make reading easier. Finally I removed the stub templates and replaced it with the expand one. --[[User:Marianika|Marianika]] ([[User talk:Marianika|talk]]) 16:32, 19 May 2008 (UTC)

== What about non-believers? ==

What about atheists, agnostics, deists in Mexico? How many Mexicans actually believe in God? Is there any data about that?  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/213.196.243.113|213.196.243.113]] ([[User talk:213.196.243.113|talk]]) 22:41, 27 May 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Mexican Ethnic Religion (Mexicayotl) ==

This article lacks a part about the growing movement of Mexicayotl, or Ethnic Mexican Culture or Religion, which is the revival of &quot;Aztec&quot; religion. --[[Special:Contributions/79.45.49.143|79.45.49.143]] ([[User talk:79.45.49.143|talk]]) 12:47, 16 August 2010 (UTC)

== Typo in Nonreligious section ==

'''John Ralph Ragazzini''' (January 3, 1912&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pnxBAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=John+Ralph+Ragazzini+1912&amp;dq=John+Ralph+Ragazzini+1912&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjC4sew9dPVAhXMHJoKHeWmAFsQ6AEIKzAB Profile of John Ralph Ragazzini]&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; November 22, 1988) was an [[United States|American]] [[electrical engineer]] and a professor of [[Electrical Engineering]]. 

==Biography==
Ragazzini was born in [[Manhattan, New York City]] and received the degrees of B.S. and E.E. at the [[City College of New York]] in 1932 and 1933 and earned the degrees of A.M. and Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at [[Columbia University]] in 1939 and 1941.

Ragazzini was dean of the School of Engineering and Science at [[New York University]] and during [[World War II]] he was chairman of the Department of Electrical Engineering at Columbia University, where he was involved in the [[Manhattan Project]].

Ragazzini's notable students are [[Rudolf E. Kálmán]] (see [[Kalman filter]]s), [[Eliahu Ibraham Jury]] (see [[Z-transform]]), [[Gene F. Franklin]] (see [[digital control]]), and [[Lotfi Asker Zadeh]] (see [[Fuzzy sets]] and [[Fuzzy logic]]).

Ragazzini is also credited, along with Lotfi Zadeh, in 1952, to have pioneered the development of the [[z-transform]] method in [[discrete-time]] [[signal processing]] and analysis.

In 1970 he received the [[Rufus Oldenburger Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asme.org/about-asme/honors-awards/achievement-awards/rufus-oldenburger-medal |title=Rufus Oldenburger Medal |publisher=[[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] |accessdate={{Format date|2013|2|14}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, [[American Automatic Control Council]] named [[John R. Ragazzini Award]] after Ragazzini and he was the first recipient of the award. Ragazzini died on 22 November 1988, aged 76.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/24/obituaries/john-ragazzini-76-educator-and-engineer.html&lt;/ref&gt;

I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under [[Wikipedia:Fair use|fair use]] but there is no [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline|explanation or rationale]] as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags/Fair use|boilerplate fair use template]], you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with [[WP:FU|fair use]].

Please go to [[:Image:Brokeninpieces.jpg|the image description page]] and edit it to include a [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline |fair use rationale]]. Using one of the templates at [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline]] is an easy way to insure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template. Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.

If there is other other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on the other images used on this page.

The '''United Church, Chapel on the Hill''' in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]] was the city's main church during [[World War II]]. Dedicated on September 30, 1943 and completed late in October 1943, it was originally a multi-denominational [[chapel]] shared by [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and [[Judaism|Jewish]] congregations.&lt;ref name=NationalRegister/&gt;&lt;ref name=churchhistory&gt;[http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=category&amp;sectionid=4&amp;id=39&amp;Itemid=55 Church History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728092956/http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=category&amp;sectionid=4&amp;id=39&amp;Itemid=55 |date=July 28, 2011 }}, United Church, Chapel on the Hill website, accessed March 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architectural design ==
The building design is a [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] 700-series [[U.S. Army]] chapel.&lt;ref name=Townsite&gt;[http://oakridgevisitor.com/history/pdf/OriginalTownSites.pdf Chapel on the Hill] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517124718/http://oakridgevisitor.com/history/pdf/OriginalTownSites.pdf |date=May 17, 2008 }} in ''Jackson Square – the original Townsite'', Oak Ridge Convention and Visitors' Bureau&lt;/ref&gt; It is a frame building built on a three-bay rectangular plan with a [[Steeple (architecture)|steeple]]d [[bell tower]] and a [[gable]] entry [[porch]]. It was one of three Army chapels built using the same design in Oak Ridge during World War II. One of the other two chapels, the West Chapel in the city's West Village area, was later torn down, but the East Chapel in the East Village is still in use.&lt;ref name=NationalRegister&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfo.doe.gov/me70/history/NPSweb/Oak_Ridge_Historic_District_(Preferred).pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form for Oak Ridge Historic District |date=July 18, 1991 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829041710/http://www.cfo.doe.gov/me70/history/NPSweb/Oak_Ridge_Historic_District_%28Preferred%29.pdf |archivedate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The U.S. Army built the chapel to house religious activities, as one of numerous community facilities in the &quot;townsite&quot; area of Oak Ridge. The building was dedicated on September 30, 1943, in a ceremony that included [[prayer]]s and talks by a Jewish [[rabbi]], a [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|Catholic priest]], an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] priest, a [[Baptist]] minister, and the [[minister (Christianity)|minister]] who was serving the United Church congregation that eventually came to own the chapel.&lt;ref&gt;Charles W. Johnson and Charles O. Jackson (1981), ''City Behind a Fence: Oak Ridge, Tennessee, 1942-1946''. The University of Tennessee Press. Pages 127-129.&lt;/ref&gt; Its name, &quot;The Chapel on the Hill,&quot; comes from a reference in a prayer by the Knoxville Baptist minister who participated in the dedication.&lt;ref name=Townsite/&gt;

The United Church congregation that is housed in the Chapel on the Hill traces its history to July 18, 1943, when some 25 to 30 Christians of diverse denominational backgrounds gathered for Sunday worship in Oak Ridge's main [[cafeteria]]. Subsequently, several members of the group made plans to establish an interdenominational Protestant church, led by [[laity|layperson]]s, to include all denominations. A [[Presbyterian]] minister working in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] was engaged to conduct weekly services, and about 150 people representing 13 Protestant denominations became charter members of &quot;the United Church&quot;. Governing boards of laypersons elected to lead the new congregation took up their duties on October 24, 1943.&lt;ref name=pre1980&gt;[http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=51&amp;Itemid=55 Pre-1980 Historical Compilation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728093006/http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=51&amp;Itemid=55 |date=July 28, 2011 }}, United Church, Chapel on the Hill website, accessed March 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Chapel-on-the-Hill was completed that same month, the United Church and the local Roman Catholic Church were given control of the building, as the only two churches then officially operating in the [[Manhattan Project]] community. During the war, when Oak Ridge's Manhattan Project facilities were operating around the clock, the chapel building was also in use nearly 24 hours a day as a venue for worship services, [[wedding]]s, and other occasions for local workers of various Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish religious backgrounds.&lt;ref name=pre1980/&gt;

At the peak of wartime activity in Oak Ridge, when the population exceeded 70,000, the United Church employed four ministers and conducted worship services in the Chapel on the Hill, East Village Chapel, and the Jefferson Theater, as well as [[Sunday school]] classes in several local schools and a [[mobile home|trailer]] camp. By 1951, the United Church Chapel-on-the-Hill consolidated as a single [[interdenominational]] congregation, making its home in the Chapel on the Hill building.&lt;ref name=pre1980/&gt;

The United Church congregation purchased the chapel and {{convert|3.72|acre|ha}} of land from the [[U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]] on May 11, 1955 for a price of $17,116.&lt;ref name=pre1980/&gt; An adjoining educational building was added in 1956-1957.

It is felt that the article you created at [[Ethan cavett]] is not suitable for a Wikipedia article, which must have a [[Wikipedia:Notability|notable]] subject and be [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verifiable]]. I have moved it to [[User:{{PAGENAME}}]], which is where users are free to write about themselves. You are at liberty to move it back into the (Main) namespace but bear in mind that if you do so, it is likely to be nominated for deletion. 

Note, however, that the purpose of a user page is to enable active editors of Wikipedia to introduce themselves to other editors. [[WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_a_blog.2C_webspace_provider.2C_or_social_networking_site|Wikipedia is not a general hosting service]], so your user page is not a personal homepage. Content unrelated to Wikipedia or its editing is likely to be removed.

Please see [[WP:User_page|the user page guidelines]], especially [[WP:User_page#What_can_I_not_have_on_my_user_page.3F|this section]] for more information. -- [[User:Omicronpersei8|Omicronpersei8]] ([[User talk:Omicronpersei8|talk]]) 19:36, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

'''Archer''' is a [[slab serif]] typeface designed in 2001 by [[Tobias Frere-Jones]] and [[Jonathan Hoefler]] for use in ''[[Martha Stewart Living]]'' magazine. It was later released by [[Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones]] for commercial licensing.

==Structure==

The typeface is a [[Slab_serif#Geometric_model|geometric]] slab serif, one with a geometric design similar to sans-serif fonts. It takes inspiration from mid-twentieth century designs such as [[Rockwell (typeface)|Rockwell]].

The face is unique for combining the geometric structure of twentieth-century European slab-serifs but imbuing the face with a domestic, less strident tone of voice. [[Ball terminal|Balls]] were added to the upper terminals on letters such as ''C'' and ''G'' to increase its charm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Devroye|first1=Luc|title=Jonathan Hoefler|url=http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-27370.html|publisher=McGill University|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Italic type|Italics]] are true italic designs, with flourishes influenced by calligraphy, an unusual feature for geometric slab serif designs. As with many [[Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones]] designs, it was released in a wide range of weights from hairline to bold, reflecting its design goal as a typeface for complex magazines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Typographica review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Earls|first1=David John|title=Archer|url=http://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/archer/|website=Typographica|accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
The typeface has been used for, among other things, branding for [[Wells Fargo]] and is a main font for the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' and [[Wes Anderson]]'s film ''[[The Grand Budapest Hotel]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=Lauren|title=Is Archer's Use on Target?|url=http://www.aiga.org/is-archers-use-on-target/|publisher=AIGI}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the current font used for titles and body text by the [[Design Observer]] website.

===[[Katisha]]===
Contains no information not in [[The Mikado]] article, the point of the spin-off unclear, as the character only appears in one opera, and it's unclear how this could expand further. In normal circumstances I'd say merge or make it a redirect, but, as I said, everything IS covered in [[The Mikado]], and I can't imagine someone searching for &quot;Katisha&quot;.

*'''Delete''' article per nomination.  Anything notable about this character should appear in the plot summary of ''[[The Mikado]]''.  There is no reason to have a separate article for this character.  -- [[User:Ssilvers|Ssilvers]] 19:59, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Redirect''' it to [[The Mikado]] -- merge isn't needed since the info's there, but the redirect could be useful -- somebody could search for it. -- [[User:ArglebargleIV|ArglebargleIV]] 22:15, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

A tag has been placed on [[:Nonamaker]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article seems to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable [[Wikipedia:Notability|(see the guidelines for notability here)]]. If you can indicate why the subject of this article is notable, you may contest the tagging. To do this, please affix the template &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; to the page and leave a note on [[Talk:Nonamaker|the article's talk page]] explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself.

Please read the [[WP:CSD|criteria for speedy deletion]] (specifically, article #7) and [[Wikipedia:Notability (people)|our general biography criteria]].

== Waterboarding ==

Could you post a link where somebody calls [[surfing]] [[waterboarding]]?  I can't seem to find any. [[User:Jehochman|Jehochman]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Jehochman|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:46, 26 April 2009 (UTC)

Yes, Waterboarding is a very common term in Hawaii, the Western US, Australia and even some former Soviet countries. Here's a link to an article where the author references this http://mydailyclarity.com/2009/03/surfing-for-peace-in-the-gaza/. Also, I found a site that references waterboarding here http://www.hawaiiansouthshore.com/shop/product.php?productid=17375. It get's confusing; I was looking for 'surfing' but we call it Waterboarding so I got to the wrong page ;-)

: Fair enough.  That source uses &quot;water boarding&quot; with a space.  I've made a change to your edit to reflect the space. [[User:Jehochman|Jehochman]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Jehochman|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:23, 26 April 2009 (UTC)</text>

I removed &quot;2006 is only his second full season as a team-manager. It took other team managers, such as [[Frank Williams]] many years to win a grand prix as manager.&quot;

This suggests Fry is responsible for a dramatic turnaround in the team's performance - their 2005 and 2006 performances have been widely acknowledged to have been poor to middling. the circumstances of the Hungarian GP were also exceptional. [[User:Mark83|Mark83]] 19:37, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

::It has been reported in the Telegraph (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/motorsport/formulaone/5369856/Monaco-Grand-Prix-Jenson-Buttons-playboy-days-behind-him.html) that Nick Fry owns a proportion of the team, and in an earlier article, that he owns the majority stake. Shouldn't this be added?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/92.239.225.23|92.239.225.23]] ([[User talk:92.239.225.23|talk]]) 23:17, 28 May 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Klein-Glienicke Schweizerhaus 1.jpg|thumb|320px|''Schweizerhaus'' in [[Klein Glienicke]] near [[Berlin]], designed by [[Ferdinand von Arnim]], 1867]]
'''Swiss chalet style''' ({{lang-de|Schweizerstil}}, {{lang-no|Sveitserstil}}) is an [[architectural style]] of [[Historicism (art)|Late Historicism]], originally inspired by rural [[chalet]]s in [[Switzerland]] and the [[Alps|Alpine]] (mountainous) regions of [[Central Europe]]. The style refers to traditional building designs characterised by widely projecting roofs and facades richly decorated with wooden balconies and carved ornaments. It spread over [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Austria-Hungary]] and [[Scandinavia]] during the ''[[Belle Époque]]'' era.

==History==
[[File:Villa Fridheim, Krøderen, 2.jpg|thumb|Villa Fridheim in [[Krødsherad]], Norway]]
Swiss chalet style originated in the [[German Romanticism|Romantic]] era of the late-18th/early-19th century, when the ideas of the [[English landscape garden]] inspired parks and residences in Germany, such as the [[Dessau-Wörlitz Garden Realm]]. It became highly appreciated on the continent by noble landowners who were impressed by the &quot;simple life&quot; of people living in the mountains. 

The chalet style soon spread over the German ''[[Mittelgebirge]]'' landscapes such as the [[Harz]] mountains or the [[Dresden]] area and the adjacent [[North Bohemia]]n region. As a &quot;modern&quot; building style, it also influenced the [[resort architecture]] along the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] seaside, like in [[Binz]] or [[Heringsdorf, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|Heringsdorf]]. Around 1900, design elements were used in the construction of numerous bourgeois family homes as well as by notable architects like [[Heinrich von Ferstel]] to build larger mansions and hotels. 

The style was further popularized by the first waves of tourism of rich people from the North and West of Europe and became popular in other parts of Europe and North America, notably in the [[architecture of Norway]], [[architecture of Iceland|Iceland]] and [[Architecture of the Netherlands|the Netherlands]] and in the [[country house]] architecture of [[architecture of Sweden|Sweden]] and [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati (Ohio, USA)]], in the late 19th and early 20th century. English examples of the chalet style include the [[Boathouse at Belton House]], [[Lincolnshire]], by [[Anthony Salvin]] and the Swiss Cottage at [[Osbourne House]], on the [[Isle of Wight]], constructed for [[Queen Victoria]]'s children.

==Characteristics==
The style is characterized by:
*[[Gabled roof|Gabled roofs]] with wide [[eaves]]
*Exposed construction beams, including large [[Bracket (architecture)|brackets]]
*Decorative carving and mouldings
*[[Balconies]]
*Large windows
*[[Weatherboarding]], usually painted, often in bright colors

The result was '''delete'''. -- [[User:Jitse Niesen|Jitse Niesen]] ([[User talk:Jitse Niesen|talk]]) 12:28, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

:In case anybody requires an explanation how I arrived at this decision, as it is a bit borderline: There seems to be only one reliable source, an article repeated in USA Today and other media. What tipped the balance is firstly the weak reasons in some of the &quot;keep&quot; comments (specifically, those of necronudist, Portillo, and I don't understand Minfo); and secondly, I think we should be extremely cautious in having articles about living children. -- [[User:Jitse Niesen|Jitse Niesen]] ([[User talk:Jitse Niesen|talk]]) 12:45, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

* '''Delete''' - he's ten years old, for crying out loud. If he makes it as a pro then add him in but not until then. [[User:Qwghlm|Qwghlm]] 20:09, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
**'''Comment''' You can't delete or not delete an article purely based on age. --[[User:Pinkkeith|Pinkkeith]] 20:11, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
***'''Comment''' - the point is that he doesn't meet [[WP:BIO]]. There are thousands of kids with potential; they get articles here when that potential is realised by playing for the first team of a significant club. WP is not a crystal ball. [[User:BlueValour|BlueValour]] 20:53, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
****'''Comment''' Well, that wasn't the point that you made, but it does pass [[WP:BIO]] based on [[WP:GOOGLE]]. There is no crystal ball to this article at all, it is all based on present information and known fact. --[[User:Pinkkeith|Pinkkeith]] 21:00, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
*****'''Comment''' What &quot;known fact?&quot;  There is not a single source cited in the entire article.  I am particularly leery of this becoming another AFD where the article is kept because of references cited in the AFD discussion that never make it into the article thus defeating the entire purpose of this discussion and [[WP:V]].  --[[User:ElKevbo|ElKevbo]] 14:26, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
*We can, however, '''delete''' an article if no reliable sources are provided when challenged under [[WP:V|verifiability policy]].  Pinkkeith, can you point us to featured coverage in mainstream media?  Some of those are needed to let us keep the article.  Being signed to a youth team isn't notable enough to get thousands of other kids their own WP articles.  [[User:Barno|Barno]] 20:39, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
** Here is a [http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/technology/maney/2005-02-01-maney_x.htm USA Today article] on him. In there the writer mentions that he was covered in numerous other newspapers. --[[User:Pinkkeith|Pinkkeith]] 20:43, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
*** - fine but he has achieved nothing in the adult world - the press references are the result of a splendid publicity campaign for his video but that doesn't confer notability. [[User:BlueValour|BlueValour]] 20:57, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
**** That's blatent [[ephebiphobia]]. Reread the article, the entire article is talking about the video and how it made him notable. --[[User:Pinkkeith|Pinkkeith]] 21:01, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

[http://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=%22Jean+Carlos+Chera%22&amp;btnG=Search+Archives&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8 Google News Archive] search yields 74 unique hits- more than enough to qualify as &quot;the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person.&quot; How old the subject is and the method in which he was made notable isn't relevant; the subject meets [[WP:BIO]]. --[[User talk:Rory096|Rory096]] 21:14, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
:*'''Comment''' - most of the content, apart from his birthdate, fails [[WP:V]]. The Ghits mean we can keep the article not that we must. They are all the result of a single video being published on the internet and they have all picked up the same story.

[[User:BlueValour|BlueValour]] 16:58, 31 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''-So he's a child prodigy, that doesn't make him notable.  Some of my friends are amazing at basketball, but they don't have any articles.  As above, if he makes it to the pros (or college, if Brazil has a college league, I dunno), then we can always repost.

*'''Delete'''  When he has played for Manchester United, Arsenal, Porto, Eindhoven or Real Madrid he will have earned his article.  Until then it is worth remembering that, at least in the UK, it would be highly improper for professional clubs to express an interest in a 10 year old, let alone to 'openly court' them.

*'''Delete''' I've reviewed some of these news articles. I can read only the English ones, which are basically the same novelty one-shot story, repeated, or something like the USA today story, which is more about how everyone is famous on the Internet than a biographical source for an article.

Many of the users are very bias against the idea of a 7yr old having its own article or the fact that his only a child prodigy, but indeed we have a child prodigy article. Im definately getting a sense of outright bias and a feeling that many of the voters here are americans. [[portillo]]

*'''Comment''' - I think most of the delete (and some of the keep) votes are completely missing the point. Of course this kid isn't a notable footballer. He is however notable as an internet/media phenomenon. Wikipedia has plenty of articles for such people, as an example go look at [[Mahir Çağrı]]. Then at the bottom of his page have a look at the categories he's placed in. When someone comes to Wikipedia and searches for &quot;that kid i saw clips of on TV&quot; or &quot;that kid my mate sent me videos of&quot; and who's name give 35,000 google hits... He should be here! [[User:Alii h|aLii]] 15:20, 6 November 2006 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' per norm. [[User:Minfo|м info]] 23:03, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - I wonder if there is a misunderstanding here? If you are a child prodigy as a piano player you can play the piano. If you are a child prodigy as a mathematician you can do complicated sums in your head. Here, the kid undoubtedly has unusual ball skills but that doesn't make him a footballer. I also don't see him as a 'internet/media phenomenon' with any longevity - with YouTube such phenonima come and go like snow in the sun. [[User:TerriersFan|TerriersFan]] 00:01, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
:He was born as a YouTube phenomen but now he's known by all of the users above, has google entries and BBC articles. Guys, you wanna delete him, let's do it. Simply there are people who search for him and people who know him, there are many articles on paper magazines about him, but if you are too zealous to keep a 9-years-old top-youngster 'cause &quot;well, dear Watson, it fails WP:BIO =_= ahem&quot; let's do it. Do it and stop arguing bullshits. --[[User:Necronudist|necronudist]] 09:24, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

The '''European Federation of [[Financial Analyst]]s Societies''' ('''EFFAS''')[http://www.effas.com] is the federation of [[financial analyst|analysts]] associations in Europe. EFFAS comprises 27 member societies representing more than 14,000 investment professionals. EFFAS was founded in 1962 and the headquarters is located in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]].

Besides its European training programme CEFA (Certified European Financial Analyst) EFFAS also grants the Certified International Investment Analysts (CIIA) designation, ensuring professional qualification by offering global as well as local market knowledge within its examination structure. As a global designation the exams can be taken in different languages. Through the national member societies EFFAS provides a full range of services for capital market experts.

==CIIA Certification==
EFFAS participates in further developing the [[Certified International Investment Analyst]] (CIIA) examinations, a financial analyst designation recognised globally. Analysts who belong to European analyst associations that are members of EFFAS, are eligible to participate in the final CIIA examination, if they pass the foundation and the national exams, or if they hold the Certified European Financial Analyst diploma (CEFA).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Big Andy, (Andrew Walsh) was born in Louisville, Ky., on Feb. 12, 1978.  His father, Frank Walsh and mother, Marsha Sils were overly delighted to have him, since their first son, Patrick, was a dud.  Big Andy was known through his childhood as being pretty funny.  His brother, not so much.  His parents divorced in 1981, after his father recuperated from emergency brain surgery, after falling through the roof at his work and landing head first on the concrete below.  He continued to work there until he passed away after a 3 year battle with melanoma, in 2006, a week before his 54th birthday.  His mom remarried and had another child, a daughter named Brittani (Gamble).</text>

{{Wikipedia subcat guideline|notability criteria|{{PAGENAME}}|[[WP:NMS]]&lt;br&gt;[[WP:SCIENCE]]}}
--&gt;
{{rejected}}

Ideas related to science are an important part of any comprehensive [[WP:ENC|encyclopedia]].  This guideline and its criteria are intended for use in determining whether a topic is notable due to being a part of or related to science.  The tests in this guideline are intended to be fairly rigirous so that a topic that is acceptable under this guideline can be considered an appropriate part of Wikipedia.  However, the failure of a topic to meet this guideline's criteria does not automatically exclude it, as it may attain notability through [[WP:N]] itself or another of its subsidiary guidelines.

==Notability of topics related to science==

The need for this guideline comes from there being a set of topics which do not fail the test of the [[Wikipedia:No original research|No original research]] policy or the [[Wikipedia:Attribution]] policy but which none the less are not appropriate to Wikipedia because they do have sufficient notability.  Such topics mostly represent new findings and theories, as well as past findings and theories that have failed to gain significant attention in either scientific circles or the public at large (or so far failed to gain said attention).

A key element to understanding this guideline is that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a research publication, and as such Wikipedia does not usurp the usual validation processes of scientific institutions such as [[peer review]], [[scientific consensus]], and academic recognition. Decisions about including or excluding material must always reflect the opinions of outside authorities, not those of Wikipedia editors. Inclusion or exclusion is therefore not a judgement on the validity, importance or accuracy of a scientific contribution, but simply a reflection of the quality and quantity of responses it received inside and outside the [[scientific community]].

This [[WP:N|notability guideline]] derives its relevance from the policies [[WP:NOT|What Wikipedia is not]] (in particular [[WP:NOT#IINFO|Not an indiscriminate collection of information]] and [[WP:NOT#CRYSTALBALL|Not a crystal ball]]), [[WP:NOR|No original research]] and [[WP:NPOV|Neutral point of view]] (in particular [[WP:NPOV#Undue weight|Undue weight]] and [[Wikipedia:Neutral point  of view/FAQ#Pseudoscience|Pseudoscience]]), as well as the guidelines [[Wikipedia:Conflict of interest|Conflict of interest]] and [[WP:AUTO|Autobiography]]. Also of importance are [[WP:V|verifiability]] and [[WP:RS|reliability]] policies.

==Criteria==
=== General ===
In general, a contribution in the field of science is notable enough to merit inclusion in Wikipedia if it meets at least one of the following criteria:

#'''Textbook science.''' There is regular non-incidental mention of the contribution in general or specialized textbooks published by reputable presses.{{ref|1|1}}
#'''Widely cited.''' Papers covering the contribution have been widely cited{{ref|2|2}} in its research field{{ref|3|3}} relative to other papers in the same area. Self-citations, and citations in journals which are not respected within the relevant research field should be excluded.
#'''Press and fiction.''' It is or was well known due to extensive press coverage, or due to being a recurrent theme in notable works of [[fiction]]. In this case the article should make note of this status. A single article on the theory, even if from a major media source such as ''[[New Scientist]]'' or ''[[Scientific American]]'', is not a sufficient criterion.
#'''Historical interest.''' It has historically met any of the above criteria within the scientific community or the culture at large but has since either been [[superseded scientific theory|superseded]], disregarded, or dismissed by the scientific community or the culture at large. The article should make note of the subject's status in this regard.
#'''Popular belief.''' It is or was believed to be true by a significant part of the general population, even if rejected by scientific authorities.

Notable topics which are primarily non-scientific in nature but which contain claims concerning scientific phenomena, should not be handled as scientific.  For example, the ''[[Book of Genesis]]'' itself is primarily covered as a religious scripture rather than as a cosmology. On the other hand, subjects such as [[creationism]] or [[creation science]], which involve a direct conflict between scientific and religious doctrine, are properly evaluated both on a scientific and theological basis. Similarly, subjects purporting to have a scientific basis may be noteworthy primarily on cultural or sociological bases, such as UFOs, which can usefully be discussed from several different perspectives.

:{{Seealso|Wikipedia:Notability (science)/Irrelevant arguments}}

===Scientific terms===
:''See also [[Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms]]
A scientific term is considered notable and worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia if the following can be established:
# A commonly agreed-upon formal or informal definition
# A trajectory of use for the term in the scientific literature from [[WP:RS|reliable]] and [[WP:V|verifiable]] sources
To determine notability it is important to keep in mind that different fields sometimes use the same term to describe different concepts. On the other hand, especially in the early stages of a field, terminology is often not standardized and different terms are used for the same concept. The policy on [[WP:NAME|naming conventions]] gives more information on the choice of the proper term when more than one term is used in the scientific literature.

== Assessing the reliability and relevance of sources ==

Journals from which citations and evidence of notability are obtained are expected to be well known and respected within the relevant research field.  The previous requirement of citation from a peer-reviewed source is not alone sufficient by this requirement.  (Peer review is done just as easily by a fringe science journal as by a leading journal, while [[Nature (journal)|Nature magazine]], one of the most respected [[scientific journals]] in existence, uses editorial as well as  peer review for submissions.)

Textbooks should either be well-known and respected or produced by a reputable scientific publisher (which is most likely the same publisher as one or more respected journals).

Journals from scientific societies of developing countries are occasionally not reliable.  If a finding in such a journal should prove to be of great scientific interest, that finding is often reprinted and/or reported in reliable scientific sources.  In such a case, the original journal article can be cited as a primary source, but its relevance should be backed up by secondary citations in known reliable sources.

For biographical articles and articles on fringe science, there is some loosening of these requirements.  Works by the topic of a biographical article are relevant to the article whether their writing was published in a reliable journal/publisher or not.  Also, the contents of a journal devoted to a fringe science can provide evidence as to the past or current thinking within that fringe field.  However, the fringe science journals cannot provide evidence for the outright notability of the topic.

==Notes==
{{note|1|Note 1}}:  The scientific contribution must have a major entry in the work. A passing mention of the concept is not sufficient. 

{{note|2|Note 2}}:  Citation counts and peer review mechanisms differ vastly between sciences, fields, and subfields, and editors are urged to inform the relevant [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Council/Directory/Science|WikiProject]] about ongoing debates to get expert input. It should also be noted that ''quantity'' of citations is often only a poor approximation of ''quality''.

{{note|3|Note 3}}:  A &quot;research field&quot; indicates an established area of study for which the topic in question is only a part.  A topic cannot be its own research field, nor can it gain notability from being part of a field which is non-notable.

__NOTOC__
===Overview===
After much deliberation of the [[Wikipedia:Danny's contest/Contest entries|contest entries]] the judges have arrived at a decision.

The entries could be broken down into three broad groups... entries that didn't seem to have much, if any, improvement, entries that were a &quot;good try&quot; and a handful of entries that really took the contest to heart and added a lot of interesting and germane references.

===Criteria===
The judges graded on 4 major criteria:
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!Criterion
!Description
!Weight
|-
|'''Number of citations'''
|Just a  raw count of how many were added. This was a good filter to see if the article could make the finalists... only 2 or 3 refs suggested that maybe not so much had been done.  
|(20%)
|-
|'''Complexity of citations'''
|A gauge of the difficulty level of adding them. Were they notes? web cites? book cites? did they use ISBN tagging? were there multiple places that got the same note? Notes ON notes? 
|(30%)
|-
|'''Appropriateness of cites'''
|Were they actually GOOD cites that moved the article forward?
|(20%)  
|-
|'''Overall article improvement'''

|'''[[Battle of Ceresole]]'''
|An important battle in medieval history, part of the [[Italian Wars]] series. Characterised by contemporaries as &quot;marvellously confused&quot; this battle is attractively illustrated with lots of maps and diagrams. One would expect Kyrill as coordinator of [[WP:MILHIST]] to do a good job of improving an article, and Kyrill does not disappoint. A very powerful article about an interesting battle.

|'''[[Theramenes]]'''
|An important general and historical figure of ancient Greece, including participating in an Athenian coup, multiple battles, and a rebellion. He even had notoriety after death. The article is challenging due to a paucity of sources, but Robth found 80+ cites. There also is an innovative organisation of sources into modern and ancient. A very good article based on some painstaking research.

|'''[[Crawford expedition]]'''
|A very understudied but important battle in the [[American Revolution]]. The winning side often tends to ignore battles they lost, and this article was not much more than a single paragraph stub when Kevin went to town on it. It is now profusely illustrated with maps, paintings, tables and diagrams and has grown to 43 Kb. In addition to 88 high quality footnotes, it also has a comprehensive &quot;references&quot; and &quot;for further reading&quot; section, properly separated out. All books have good ISBN links. This article is a real tour de force and shows the power of our encyclopedia well.

That all of these articles were somehow military related was surely coincidence! :)

'''Joe Eubanks''' (born 1975) is an [[United States|American]] [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] best known by the [[ring name]] '''Lobo'''. He wrestled primarily in [[Combat Zone Wrestling]] (CZW), where he won every major championship and was the first inductee into the [[CZW Hall of Fame]] in 2004. He was formerly the CZW Commissioner/Talent Coordinator.&lt;ref name=&quot;Online World of Wrestling&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/040207.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling 5th Anniversary Show February 7, 2004 - Philadelphia, Pennsylvania - ECW Arena|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===1999-2002===
Along with [[Nick Gage]], [[Justice Pain]], and [[Ric Blade]], Lobo was trained by [[John Zandig]] at the CZW Wrestling School and graduated first in the class.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freewebs.com/andy_czw1/history.html CZWHookup : The history of CZW] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210134119/http://www.freewebs.com/andy_czw1/history.html |date=2008-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He became one of the main wrestlers in CZW along with other graduates from the school. In February 1999, Lobo became the second [[CZW Iron Man Championship|Iron Man Champion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Online World of Wrestling&quot;/&gt; He held the title until June when he lost it to Justice Pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/990619.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling - CZW Down in Flames June 19, 1999 - Mantua, NJ |accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two continued wrestling each other and competed in the first ever Cage of Death match at the first ''Cage of Death'' show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/991016.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling - CZW Cage of Death October 16, 1999 - Mantua, NJ|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lobo won the match and regained the title. He would lose this title to [[Matt Prince|Wifebeater]], but regain it one more time the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/000311.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling - CZW March Violence March 11, 2000 - Sewell, NJ|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lobo also challenged for the [[CZW World Heavyweight Championship|CZW Heavyweight Championship]]. He feuded with Zandig for the title and finally beat him in July 2000. He held the title until ''Cage of Death II''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/000909.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling - CZW Cage of Death II....After Dark September 9, 2000 - Sewell, NJ|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that show, Lobo successfully defended the championship against Zandig in the Cage of Death match. Directly following this match, Justice Pain came out and fought Lobo in another Cage of Death match. In the match, Lobo was thrown from the top of the cage to the ground through a table covered in barbed wire. Justice Pain went on to win the match and the title.&lt;ref name=&quot;Online World of Wrestling&quot;/&gt;  After losing the title, Lobo continued feuding with Zandig. This time, the feud was for ownership of CZW. On February 9, 2002, Lobo defeated Zandig to become the new owner of CZW. He held this position until ''Cage of Death IV'' when Zandig defeated him to regain his position as CZW's owner &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/021213.html|title=Combat Zone Wrestling December 13, 2002 - Philadelphia, PA - Viking Hall|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2003-present===
He took some time off from CZW following the Cage of Death match. While he was gone, a new group called the Hi-V tried to take over CZW, with Zandig as their main target. Zandig was planning to face the Hi-V at ''Cage of Death V'', but the stable outnumbered his team 6 to 4. At ''Night of Infamy II'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/031115.html|title=Night of Infamy II - November 15, 2003 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lobo made a shocking return to help Zandig and join his team just in time for Cage of Death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/031213.html|title=Cage of Death V December 13, 2003 - Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |accessdate=2009-08-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their team was successful. In February 2004, Lobo became the first inductee to the CZW Hall of Fame. After this, Lobo remained inactive for the following two years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Online World of Wrestling&quot;/&gt;

At [[Cage of Death 7]], [[Zandig]], who had turned on the fans, wanted to run CZW the way they used to. He called out Lobo, who was backstage for the event, and they joined each other along with [[Justice Pain]] and [[Nick Gage]]. They would later call themselves the Forefathers of CZW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/czw/_2006/|title=2006 results

*'''Speedy Delete''' - for blatant advertising.  I waited a bit to see how this one would play out before making a decision, but as much good faith as I normally assume, there is no sticking up for this one.  The article's [[User:Kobius|prime editor]] (and incidentally, the forum admin) removed the AfD tag from the page and does not take kindly to other editors touching 'his' page.  The whole layout of the article is clearly trying to draw viewers into the forums, perhaps to meet the admitted goal of 500,000 posts.  Add these to the issues others have pointed out and there's really no need for further discussion.

The Anizone is a large site and I think if someone wants to find out more about it they come to the best internet dictionary in the world and they research on of the largest best sites. The site has a largely amount of fair people considering it has been hacked three times. The admin accidently remoe it thinking it would be delete and he was not the maker of the page but it was I.

==BBC News Report and the pilot &quot;looking for a good place to crash&quot;==

The BBC article states that the pilot was looking for a good place to put the aircraft down; he missed some park and instead put the aircraft down in an uninhabited area near Stockport city centre. The evidence does not justify this supposition whatsoever. For one thing, the AIB report states that the aircraft was likely uncontrollable after the engines cut out, and might not have been controllable even before then. The first officer died and the captain suffered retrograde amnesia, so we don't know what went on in the cockpit. There isn't the tiniest shred of evidence that the pilot &quot;put the aircraft down&quot; someplace safe. It was likely just coincidence - there are a lot of empty or disused areas around airports and under approach paths (and *that* is often deliberate).

This is such a common urban legend/media foofah. Every time a plane doesn't actually fall out of the sky, some media type comes up and says the pilot was &quot;looking for a place to crash that wouldn't cause injuries on the ground&quot;. I don't blame the Wikipedian who put this in at all, because he/she likely didn't have any sources other than the BBC article. I am blaming the BBC for making a supposition not supported by the facts.

I suppose people want to think that in an emergency the first thing the pilot will do is look for a safe place to crash. It makes them feel less worried about an aircraft crashing into their home, school, or place of business. It ain't necessarily so, though; in fact it almost is never so. Aircraft about to crash are more often than not uncontrollable - that's why they crash. --[[User:Charlene.fic|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot; face=&quot;Matisse ITC&quot;&gt;Charlene&lt;/font&gt;]] 19:40, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

Edited to add: The cause of the accident wasn't &quot;pump failure&quot; (boo, BBC, again). It was a design error in the fuel line. --[[User:Charlene.fic|&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot; face=&quot;Matisse ITC&quot;&gt;Charlene&lt;/font&gt;]] 20:02, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

:Apologies. That would have been my factual faux pas. Thank you for correcting my blathering and making this article respectable. :) [[User:Legion89|Legion]] 13:56, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

A second's more flight and the plane would catastrophically have taken the tower off Stockport's fine Town Hall and crashed into the facade of the (then) infirmary opposite the Town Hall, blocking the main road between that runs from Manchester through Stockport to the south - AG, Stockport.

== Additional cause of this crash ==

I remember seeing a BBC program about this crash. It reported on the findings of the inquiry. It said that there was an additional reason for the crash.

Apparently, the engine speeds were shown in the cockpit on two dials, one for each wing. Each dial had two hands, one for each engine and each labelled with the engine number.

This had been serviced, and a mistake had been made so that engine 3 was connected to the hand marked &quot;4&quot;, and engine 4 to hand &quot;3&quot;.

I think it was engine 4 that was starved of fuel. The pilot saw from the dial that engine 3 had stopped, so he switched off / feathered engine 3. Now both engines on the right wing were out. (This would explain why engine 4 was windmilling.)

As part of the investigation, they tried flying a similar aircraft with engines 3 and 4 both out, and discovered that the aircraft could not be flown properly.

Now, I mention all this because it is an interesting story. Also, because I want to apply the moral to setting up a computer cluster. I want to avoid the possibility of one computer failing and a different one being taken out for service by mistake, thereby bringing down the cluster. 

Does anyone know more about this? [[User:Mm67|Mm67]] 11:44, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

==Is [[Wikipedia:Notability (science)]] a consensus guideline?==
Please state your position, '''yes''' or '''no''', explain your position and defend it.  This is not a vote.  [[User:SmokeyJoe|SmokeyJoe]] 10:47, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Yes''' I consider it one, and I'm not sure what objection people have - if there's a problem that needs fixing, let's fix it.  I already refer to it, guideline or not, since it's very useful.  --[[User:Minderbinder|Minderbinder]] 12:38, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Yes''' Not only is it a consensus guideline, it is absolutely vital for Wikipedia to have such a guideline. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 12:51, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Yes''' I certainly support this guideline, what it is trying to do, and how it is trying to achieve it. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:10, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Yes''' We're ready to go into the stage where changes should be discussed here before being implemented in the policy page. ~ [[User:Trialsanderrors|trialsanderrors]] 17:40, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* '''Absolutely''' We've numerous AfDs and arbcom cases which have documented that this is the community's intent. --[[User:EngineerScotty|EngineerScotty]] 17:44, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
* I don't see where the proposed criteria add meaningful advice to writters or evaluators, and the preamble/text is way too long to be practical.  Please cite some examples of AfD where this proposal would have ensured an outcome other than what would have been achieved under the current guidelines.  For each of the criteria now listed I belive that proper application of WP:N and WP:ATT would acheive the same results.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 17:54, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
** There is [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Electric universe (concept)]], where this standard helped to refine the arguments that finally got the topic removed.  The aupporters trying to use this guideline to buoy their cause ended up only showing all the more that the article did not belong in Wikipedia.  &lt;br&gt;You are correct that in the end articles that are removed will be so removed (or not) due to policy concerns.  The need for this guideline comes from its ability to focus the debate on the issues that are important in the relevant cases.  In other words, it helps to achieve the &quot;proper application&quot; that you are claiming makes this guideline irrelevant. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 18:22, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
*** EMS, could your purpose be acheived with an essay?  Among the problems with permutations from guidelines and policies is the evolution into redundant and conficting guidance to the point that writers and evaluators become confused and the branches work at cross purposes.  My frequent analogy is the US Tax Code, which has bread several large industries for interpretation and application.  Writing complex rule sets requires great skill and caution. --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 18:34, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
*** On review of the Electric universe (concept) AfD, it appears to be resoundingly rejected with the tools we already have, most convincingly original research and few reliable sources.  This outcome is consistent with other scientific and academic issues which I have seen defeated at AfD. An excellent nomination doesn't hurt either! --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 18:42, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
**** Right now I am wondering what your agenda is here, as this type of opposition usually comes from someone who has lost an AfD in part due to this and the guidelines and is seeking to water down the standards.  One of the factors that helped with the electric universe AfD was the the nominator was also working on this guideline and used its insights in writing the nom.  Beyond that, there is the basic issue of moving beyond &quot;peer review&quot; as a standard for inclusion, a test passed by numerous non-notable articles that I have seen.  Also, I at least have gone to some pains to couch this as a setting standard for inclusions instead of exclusion.  That way, an argument that &quot;X calls for inclusion&quot; renders this guideline moot as a refutation, and so avoids the types of conflicts that in our laws make being a lawyer such a profitable profession. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 19:16, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
***** My agenda is not as you assert, but your question is a fair one, which I will answer.  My agenda is clarity in the grand scheme of notability guidelines, without a specific prejudice to this proposal. Please visit the discussion page for WP:N to see that there are many people expressing concerns over the whole process.  I support the concept of &quot;encyclopedic suitability&quot;, which we call notablility at WP, for lack of a better name.  I also consider myself a moderate inclusionist.  I am a frequent participant in Afd.  You are correct in one respect, that I origninally became involved in AfD and notability, because I saw too many abuses by uninformed editors who were deleting meanigful articles, though not specifically in the field of science.  My interest is in history and sailing.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 19:33, 16 March 2007 (UTC) 
******Might I recommend that your &quot;no&quot; comment seems to be motivated more by a general dislike for [[WP:N]] rather than a specific distaste for this particular guideline. In particular, the motivation behind this guideline was in part due to a charge made during the [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Pseudoscience|Pseudoscience arbitrartion case]] that such a guideline should exist to fend off charges related to whether an idea was notable in a scientific sense. One can argue whether [[WP:N]] should exist or not, but that's not for us to decide here. It is absolutely not true that this guideline is redudant: there is no other place where it is indicated what makes a scientific idea notable for inclusion in the encyclopedia. [[WP:NOR]] doesn't help because &quot;originality&quot; is a vague concept related to heavily to [[WP:V]] and [[WP:COI]] to be useful when people just make random articles about ostensibly scientific subjects they read about online, for example. [[WP:A]] doesn't help because there are scientific ideas which are not notable (the general consensus of the community is that they do not belong in the encyclopedia) which nevertheless are attributable to reliable sources. [[WP:NPOV]] doesn't work because the exclusion criteria at [[WP:NPOV#Undue weight]] is unable to distinguish between majority and minority except by [[WP:CON|consensus]]. That's why this guideline is needed and why it is used. Look at all the pages that link here and tell me that it isn't referred to. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 13:09, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
* No, it's not.  I think the burden of some evidence that this guideline is widely supported and necessary needs to be shown from the supporters.  Right now it's an initiative, a proposal with stable wording.  However, even in the &quot;test cases&quot; that I looked at, it seems that this guideline isn't being referred to, and evaluation of the articles in question isn't done with these guidelines in mind, rather, articles are mainly evaluated from a point of view of adequate sourcing and original research issues, in other words, policies we already have.  (I do think the editors here have reached a reasonably stable consensus, though.  But that doesn't, to me, make a &quot;consensus guideline,&quot; which implies support from the community overall.)[[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:04, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
**The evidence is in the ''What links here'' tool you can access from the toolbox. I think that you may have a hidden agenda here: you tend to be a bit too quick to agree to a supression bias against non-experts in the fields of science. Is this a misplaced concern? --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 13:09, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
***First of all there are over 150 things that link to [[Wikipedia:Notability (science)]], so it's not unreasonable to expect evidence to be actually gathered by someone trying to make a case.  But more, I went to a few of those &quot;what links here&quot; and apparently the only reason they were linked was that trialsanderrors mentioned that the debate was a test case: not people actually referring to the guideline and trying to use it.  Look at the Electric Universe AfD, for instance, which is the best example I've seen of a borderline-notable scientific theory (where this guideline might help).  [[WP:SCIENCE]] was not used as an argument in the debate, even by you, and the arguments that led to it being deleted were not even much along the lines of what is presented here in the guideline, but were according to core Wikipedia policies like [[WP:ATT]], [[WP:OR]] and so on.  Some of the argument is covered here in the introduction, but the &quot;criteria&quot; part played no role and seems to be central to this as a notability guideline.  So, this is what I mean when I say that no evidence has been presented.  What do YOU mean when you say this is a consensus guideline?  [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:43, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
****The criteria part played a huge role. The only criteria that EU could have come close to satisfying was recognition in popular culture/outside media and we showed that it was not notable along those lines. The guidelines at the time were being formulated and weren't as clear as they are now, but thanks to discussions such as that AfD we have a clearer demarcation. I think you need to read through the AfD we reference again and look carefully at how the criteria line-up with the criteria outlined in this guideline. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:02, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
*****Could you show me precisely where?  I don't mean to be dense, but I really don't see it.  I see your point #5 in the nomination, but that sounds like the core [[WP:N]] argument, and not related to the criteria here.  And anyway, saying the the EU debate influenced [[WP:SCIENCE]] kind of precludes that the EU debate can be thought of as evidence that this is a consensus guideline.  Can you show me ANY AfD debate that explicitly references the criteria?  [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:17, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
******Number 5 in the nomination. While it doesn't explicitly reference this page, it does so implicitly (and if I recall correctly at the time the standards were still being developed as to which criteria were going to be grouped with which). --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:20, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
*******Again, #5 was really along the lines of basic [[WP:N]].  Again, show me any debates that explicitly reference the criteria.  There's a difference between this proposal being wise or balanced or sensible and it having ''broad community support.''  [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:44, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
********Basic [[WP:N]]&quot;? That's a bit of WikiLawyering I haven't come across before. The fact is that #5 has direct parallels to our criteria here. You can thrust your head in the sand over this all you want, but that's the plain truth of the matter. And now you reposition your attack to claim that there isn't &quot;broad community support&quot;, but let me remind you that arbcomm members entreatied the community to develop these standards in the first place and that by virtue of this being a Wiki it will end up as balanced and sensible as possible. I'm beginning to think you are being a stick-in-the-mud for reasons you aren't coming clean about. Help me out, explain to me why you always seem to be fighting against scientific accuracy at Wikipedia so I can [[WP:AGF|assume good faith]] towards your contributions. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 17:36, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
***I suggest you go read [[WP:AGF]] and actually take it to heart.  In our current discussion, you seem to have trouble differentiating between (1) my personal support or opposition of the proposal and (2) my arguing that the proposal isn't a &quot;consensus guideline&quot;, that is, that it doesn't have broad support.  This wouldn't be a very hard difference to understand if you had been assuming good faith of me in the first place.  For the record, I support some of what the proposal says but not all of it, but that wasn't the basis for my objections: calling the proposal a &quot;consensus guideline&quot; is wrong, because this is still a very new proposal, barely even stable enough to judge.  [[WP:PROF]] remained a proposal for a very long time, and finally became a guideline when it became apparent that the guideline had influenced the way decisions were being made, and that the community, de facto, embraced the guideline.  Creation of policies and guidelines is slow and for good reason, especially when actionable changes are being proposed (like the criteria here).

****I appreciate your candor regarding your opinions of the content of this guideline because that is precisely what concerns me. However, I do feel that you are being a bit oblique in your commentary. &quot;Policy creation is slow,&quot; is often the cry of those who want to slow things down, and people tend to drag their feet for a reason. To me and many of the other editors who commented above, this guideline is ''de facto'' in place and isn't a proposal because we as editors abide by it. As you know, Wikipedia policies and guidelines are not written to affect change in the encyclopedia, but rather are meant to describe what actively goes on in editing. A good number of those who say that this is a consensus guideline edit a lot of science-related articles and so should be the ones to tell whether or not this guideline applies. I don't see that you are actively doing this as such. I do see you stepping into disputes regarding science-related articles often, and there are many times I see these actions as being in something of a contravention of the guidelines outlined here. I am being very up-front about my distrust of your motivations, but in so doing I'm also trying to assume good-faith as much as I can. Part of assuming good-faith is being transparent about one's perceptions and I'm offering you the opportunity to explain yourself as transparently as possible so we can move on. I don't like being lectured about [[WP:AGF]] when I was the one who brought it up, it looks to me like you are asking me to turn a blind eye towards our long history here at the encyclopedia and I am honestly telling you I'm having a hard time doing it because of the nature of this particular dispute we're having. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 13:53, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
*****You are making false implications about me, and I want it to stop.  [[WP:CIV|Comment on my comments]].  You say this is an attempt to document how Wikipedia works?  I respectfully disagree -- this talk page and its archives are full of debates about what the criteria ''should'' be, with very little discussion or analysis of how things are actually decided now.  (Some, but not much.)  From perusing the test cases, it seems to me that people are nearly exclusively deciding on these cases on the basis of [[WP:OR]], [[WP:ATT]], and [[WP:NPOV]], (and to a degree, [[WP:N]]), without much need for arguments specific to issue that the topics under discussion are scientific ones.  Since that ''isn't'' the content of this proposal, I cannot agree that this is documenting current Wikipedia practice, but if you want to try to change my mind, please show me specific examples so we can discuss them.  In any case, you should advertise this debate on [[WP:VPR]]; the general Wikipedia community should have a chance to comment.

******Whether they are false or not, they are simply my questions regarding your, frankly, obstinate resistance to this particular document. I am trying to be as forthright as possible here, and your increasingly haughty responses only confuse me further since you still haven't addressed directly my concerns regarding the history we have surrounding issues such as this. I disagree that the discussions are centering around how things &quot;should&quot; be. Rather I see discussions centering around generalizing from the experience that editors have. You also seem to be under the opinion that just because people reference older and more established policies and guidelines they aren't also considering this guideline. This I find to be particularly problematic because it ignores the words of people that aren't appended with a WP-acronym. Just because somebody doesn't cite this directly doesn't mean that you can't see the criteria being applied (as per our earlier discussion on EU deletion). I would hope that you would look more closely at the deletion discussions surrounding this and see if you can't spot the criteria in action. I am not going to advertise the debate anywhere, but you are free to do so. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 16:27, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
*******I've advertised the debate at [[WP:VPR]].  In terms of the status: you see one thing, I see another thing.  I'm not going to change my opinion by simply being told &quot;please look more closely,&quot; although you could convince me if you actually showed me some evidence.  I do see a lot of attempts at guiding the community: take a look at [[#&quot;Conference topic&quot; is a backdoor]], for instance, or [[#One final thought]]: people are discussing how to make a good rule, not what the rule is, organically.

****I'm with SA here: [[WP:N]] is being criticized partly because of its extreme generality.  No reason to think the entire idea of notability for all topics must pause just because of that.

****  The problem lies less with any individual sub-guideline, but more with a plethora of permutations leading to confusion.

***** I don't see any bedlam here.  I see this as being a well crafted guideline that is dealing with issues which are out-of-scope for the more general guideline due to its broad nature.  This guideline deals with the issues of science and science-related topics, and how to implement the notability guidelines within that context.&lt;br&gt;I have looked at the [[WP:N]] discussion and I get the feeling that you are doing your best to create uncertainty and confusion there.  And now you are trying to do the same here.  I for one have no need for it, and support this guideline as a reflection of the legitimate sense of the science editors here as to what is valid. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 18:23, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
*Yes, this appears to be a consensus guideline. The opposition to this guideline proposal may be part of a campaign in which User:Kevin Murray in the past month has placed &quot;rejected&quot; , &quot;disputed&quot; , or &quot;historical&quot; , or &quot;essay&quot; labels on about a dozen notability proposals or guidelines or has nominated them for deletion on the grounds that there was no consensus or that they constituted &quot;instruction creep&quot; or were redundant. A proposal is not necessarily impossible to reach consensus upon just because a few editors oppose it.

** I see your point.  This editor really, really has a grudge against the concept of notability, and I would love to know why.  If you want to do a [[WP:RfC]] against him, I am will be happy to second it.  This is ridiculous. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 19:42, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
*** No EMS, this editor, has a &quot;grudge&quot; against needless and redundant rule making for the sake of rule making.  I strongly support the concept of encyclopedic suitability which we call &quot;notability&quot; at WP.  This is not &quot;ridiculous&quot; but based on observations from life experience, that too many conficting rules create confusion rather than clarity.  Complex rule-sets require incredible cross coordination among the permutations, which is not happening here at WP, as guidelines are multiplying like rabbits without consideration of the big picture.  If you propose an RfC, please do so in the best interest of WP, not &quot;against&quot; me; this is not personal and reviewing the discussions will reveal that my actions are well supported.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 14:18, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
****There are plenty of Wikipedians who [[WP:IAR|agree with you about hating rules]]. However, might I suggest that you are going about it the wrong way. We are here writing this guideline because we need to summarize what has been done in regards to this issue. Your own personal distaste for the way in which editors have gone about doing this is probably best argued elsewhere: it certainly has nothing to do with whether consensus exists for this particular guideline. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:29, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
*** I do not see '''any''' need to coordinate this guideline with any other guidelines beside [[WP:N]] itself.  Although I am doing my own &quot;[[WP:NOR|original research]]&quot;, I have seem enough -uh- &quot;stuff&quot; offered by others such that I see a need to draw a firm and reasonable as to what is and is not acceptable here.  Until it has some reasonable amount of recognition in the scientific community, I see an article on my ideas as being an abuse of Wikipedia.  Yet I am unusual in that most other editors of Wikipedia with alternate ideas are here to promote those ideas, and they hate guidelines like this one with a purple passion because they help to keep their OR out.&lt;br&gt;BTW - I do see where you have had some success with you anti-Notability campaign.  Personally I think that you are doing Wikipedia a real disservice with it, and what you are stifling is not a bunch useless rule-making but instead needed elaborations on the meaning of Notability in various domains.  As has been noted in [[Wikipedia_talk:Notability|the WP:N discussion]], there is a level of subjectiveness in determining notability.  The need for these subsidary guidelines is to limit that subjectiveness, and thereby make this concept more usable.  Instead you are trying to pull the rug out from under Notability, something that will make the removal of questionable material much more difficult than it should be. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 16:08, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''the real test''' is whether the guidelines here will be accepted in practice. Both the above positions are to some degree correct: the guideline should reflect what its eds. believe to be the common feeling of the community, but it shouldalso point in the direction of where the consensus appears to be moving, and to be making recommendations from those most involved in edited these articles to guide thos less familiar. I think it will prove to be accepted because it is relatively straightforward, not complex -- at least by comparison -- and, in my view it does reflect the general voice. But we shall see. 
::The real dispute , I think, is over the notability of fringe science and whether that can be considered science in any sense at all. This is a matter in which I think there is in fact no real consensus, but at best a temporary majority, and i expect this  question to continue to be the theme of AfDs. I don't think this guideline  lays it to rest '''[[User:DGG|DGG]]''' 23:36, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
::: This guideline cannot and should not judge whether something is &quot;real science&quot;.  In fact, all that a determination that something is &quot;not science&quot; can do here is to remove a topic from being judged by this criteria with no resolution on its notability or lack thereof.  IMO, we have a set of criteria here such that anything that is meant to be judged as part of science can be ruled on here, be it mainstream or fringe.  What I think that you will find is that the least palatable topics are those which also have had the least impact and are also therefore the least notable.  --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 01:53, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

== Some suggestions on organizing this project page ==

* The introduction is too long.  Limit it to &quot;what&quot; and &quot;why&quot;.  Get the commentary (i.e. &quot;impetus&quot;) and discussion of process into its own section.  Specifically address what makes ''science'' different from other areas covered by the general guidelines.
* Criteria should define at least these categories as guidance to editors:
** topics which on their face should be include (i.e. the notable)
** topics which are going to require some judgments to be made by editors if they are new articles or added to existing articles. (i.e. the maybe notable)
** topics which, at least according to the authors of the guideline, are ''improbably'' included. (i.e. nonnotable)
* The statement ''&quot;Decisions about including or excluding material must always reflect the opinions of outside authorities, not those of Wikipedia editors.&quot;'' is bizarre because the opinion of Wikipedia editors is what, by definition, compose the Wikipedia. ''&quot;Must always&quot;'' is a rather strange term to be found in a mere ''guideline'' at any rate. [[User:Patsw|patsw]] 13:22, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

:: If you wish to draft an alternate version, the feel free to do so ''elsewhere'' and present it to us as a possible replacement.  We are certainly amenable to productive changes.  However, IMO the current project page works and should be considered a functioning guideline. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:13, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
:I agree the ''reflect outside authorities'' wording is odd (although not any odder than &quot;notability is not subjective&quot; which expresses the [[WP:ATT|same sentiment]]). The rest doesn't strike me as an improvement. ~ [[User:Trialsanderrors|trialsanderrors]] 17:49, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

::One point that isn't being made (in the intro) and probably should be is the point that scientific theories cannot be properly presented without understanding their level of acceptance.  There's a big difference between a mainstream theory and a fringe theory, and even in an article about a fringe theory, it's important to describe it as one.  However, for some fringe theories, insufficient sources exist to back up the claim that they are fringe theories.  Thus we are left with only one real choice: disallow the article, as we cannot properly cover it while adhering to [[WP:ATT]] and [[WP:NPOV]].  This is different from, say, an article about a band, where it may be that no source reports on their popularity or number of fans accurately, but sources do report on other things: the information we can't cover can just be left out.  In articles on science, we really can't leave that out.  [[User:Mangojuice|Mango]][[Special:Contributions/Mangojuice|&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;'''juice'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mangojuice|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:41, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

:::The &quot;level of acceptance&quot; argument makes no sense to me. &quot;Theory&quot; in science has a very precise meaning which applies to models and descriptions which are as completely accepted as possible in an endeavor based primarily on the dubious activity of inductive reasoning. While there is a big difference between mainstream and fringe proposals, the proposals themselves are only considered &quot;theories&quot; when they pass the tests of the scientific method. What makes a proposal fringe is, ostensibly, its inability to pass these tests. This doesn't mean that scientists don't make mistakes in pejoratively labeling the fringe out of the mainstream, only to say that the level of acceptance is something of a binary operator: either it's in or it's out. When an idea does not generate enough interest in the scientific community to create commentary from members of the community, it must either be uncontroversial (as is the case with textbook knowledge) or it must be outside the scientific community. This is quite easy to verify. No amount of posturing and insisting on the part of a fringe idea's proponents that the idea is actually &quot;scientific&quot; is good enough when demarcating for our purposes. We might still have articles on the idea if there is &quot;extra-scientific&quot; interest in it, but we do not need to shy away from being honest about its &quot;extra-scientific&quot; nature. One of the problems that many pro-fringe editors have is that they believe that because [[negative proof|proving the negative]] is in principle a defiance of [[WP:ATT]] that reasonable editors can't make editorial judgments with regards to the status of a particular idea. This is simply not the case at all: we are editing an encyclopedia not compiling a list of sources. After all, that's why we have editors in the first place: we are charged with summarizing the available data in the most conformist way possible. When all the data is outside the scientific community and the idea purports to have scientific importance, it is perfectly fine to delineate the contradiction. However, this discussion is probably better suited for [[WP:FRINGE]]. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:09, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

*I think it is a little more complicated than that.
*It is not ''necessary'' to give an indication of the acceptance of a theory, in order to describe it.
*And I don't think the word &quot;theory&quot; has such a precise meaning as scientists would like. For example, Wikipedia calls the [[Big Bang]] a &quot;theory&quot;, whereas the Encyclopedia Britannic calls it a &quot;Model&quot;. And I am sure there are more sources supporting both.
*This is why the new [[WP:A]] is so important. I can attribute both the Big Bang Theory, and the Big Bang Model, but I can find no source which agues it must be one or the other.
*I can also find no attribution labelling many minority subjects as &quot;fringe&quot;, nor claiming a certain level of acceptance. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 17:47, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

== Making this an approved guideline ==

I notice that Kevin Murray has downgraded this guideline back to the &quot;proposed&quot; status.  I would revert that myself, except that I am not at all clear by what action/authority it became considered a functioning guideline.  Certainly the above poll has produced only five people who support this as a guideline.  Even without the two nay-sayers I fail to see how the five of us constitute a group that can speak for the Wikipedia community as a whole, or at least the science editors.

I for one do call for the issue of approving this as a functioning guideline be presented to the community as a whole.  [[Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)|the Village Pump policy forum]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Science|WikiProject Science]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Physics|WikiProject Physics]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Chemistry|WikiProject Chemistry]], [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Biology|WikiProject Biology]] are all places where this guideline can be advertised and input and approval sought.  I see little danger in this and much promise, but mostly I would like to be able to show Kevin a formal approval so that is downgrading of this guideline cannot occur again. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 02:17, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

::We don't do &quot;formal&quot; and &quot;official&quot; with respect to guidelines. What matters is if this is (1) a good idea and (2) used as such in practice.

Judged by this talk page and AFD, the answer to all three is 'yes', so this page is a de facto guideline and Kevin is the lone dissenter here. Of course, putting a notice on the village pump never hurts.

:::Kevin is not the only dissenter, I also am.  Let me enumerate some general criticisms, this time relating to the substance of the proposal.  1.  There is not a big need for this.  Most science articles up for deletion are up for other concerns than notability, primarily, concerns that the article is original research, POV, or inadequately sourced.  Although there are many debates on the test pages subpage, in very few was the critical issue the notability of the subject: [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Electric universe (concept)]], [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Socionomics]], and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Growing Earth Theory]] (and the old debates, not listed there, about [[Time Cube]]).  2.  The list of criteria, a core part of this proposal, were not used as the basis of successful arguments in any of the key examples I listed.  Rather, the test seems to be the general one of being covered in multiple independent sources, inside or outside of the scientific community.  Note that the criteria give an opportunity to supporters of OR articles (real OR, not neutral attempts at describing published research) to argue for inclusion inappropriately: see [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sorce theory]] as an example of this.  The criteria have changed since then, but the same kind of argument could be made today.  I wouldn't want to jeopardize any of those debates by having a guideline here with such minimal applicability.  3.  The list of criteria is instruction creep and isn't useful.  For articles that should be deleted, not meeting the criteria doesn't make a strong argument.  For articles that should be kept, they're okay, but arguments to delete things that meet these criteria are weak delete arguments in the first place, usually along the lines of &quot;this article is in bad shape&quot;, see [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ubiquitous computing]] for example.  The criteria seem aimed at solving a non-existant problem of the over-deletion of notable science topics.

*The fundamental flaw of [[WP:SCIENCE|Notability (science)]], is that it tries to determine only whether an article is '''scientifically''' notable. It does not consider whether an article may be notable in '''any''' other area.

*: This is a true red herring IMO.  A failure of scientific notability does not mean that an article may have notability in another manner and therefore be worthy of inclusion.  I did have wording here to that effect at one time, but it seems to have been lost.  I will see to restoring that, as I see this guideline as being usable only as a means of inclusion.  For the purposes of exclusion, the failure of a topic to merit inclusion under any guideline (including this one) is the relevant matter. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:27, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
*:  (Edit conflict) Agree with EMS; The page clearly embraces the idea that popular notability for science topics is appropriate.  Since popular notability definitely is acceptable (see the [[Time Cube]] precedent, for instance), any wording that implies otherwise should be examined.  But you aren't correctly representing the main thrust of the proposal.

::*I did not suggest that failing scientific notability means that an article MUST be notable elsewhere. I wrote that it MAY be notable elsewhere. Yet the current policy does not consider this.
::*Deleting articles based on scientific notability alone, is an incredible conceit, and should play no part of the proposed guidelines. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 17:35, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
:::*I'm not sure what your point is.  If an article is scientifically notable, fine, it's keepable.  If an article is not notable scientifically, but notable in some other way (for example, in popular culture), fine, it's keepable.  But if the article is not notable in any way at all, why should it be kept?

::::*A number of articles have already been deleted, based on whether they were scientifically notable only, or worse, ''mainstream'' scientifically notable.

:::::* So what?  I see this as something that can and should happen.  If no other grounds are being offerred to justify notability, then the article should go.  I would point out that the deleted items cited as being &quot;non-mainstream&quot; are also considered &quot;non-notable&quot;, while other items have been kept as being &quot;notable&quot; but &quot;fringe&quot;.  It seems to me that this shows that this is a reasonable and workable scheme. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 22:09, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

::::::*No other grounds for notability are offered because the articles are considered only as to whether they are scientifically notable.
::::::*For example, the article on [[Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Ralph_Juergens|Ralph Juergens was deleted]] (a) based on a Scientific notability &quot;test case&quot; (b) on the grounds that he was a &quot;non-notable non-mainstream scientist&quot;, which is accurate, but no cause for deletion by itself.
::::::*It is improper for &quot;Notability (science)&quot; to '''solely''' judge any article for deletion, as it makes no attempt to attract expert editors in other fields --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 23:12, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

:::::::* If you are saying that a deleted article had another non-scince reason for being notable, then please name it and indicate why that reason was not considered at the time.  Also do note that in such cases a request for reconsideration can be made to [[Wikipedia:Deletion review]].  However, this standard is for determining notability with respect to science, and I find it to be quite silly and disingenuous to accuse this guideline of not doing something that it is not meant to so (namely seeking non-science-related reasons for inclusion). --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 01:56, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

::::::::* Ian, I hear you.  However your objections are ''way'' off base here, because what you don't like is that a consensus of Wikipedia editors has disagreed with your stance on certain topics.  That doesn't really have any bearing on whether or not that consensus exists.  You talk like [[WP:SCIENCE]] got Ralph Juergens deleted: no.  A consensus of editors and a discussion got it deleted, and frankly, it wasn't even based on [[WP:SCIENCE]] at all, more like on [[WP:BIO]] or [[WP:PROF]].

:::::::::*No, I am criticizing the make-up of the consensus, which is predominantly science-oriented editors who decided that Ralph Juergens was not notable because he was not a mainstream scientists; That is what the summary says. The AfD was not targeted outside of Notability (Science).
:::::::::*The main reason given for deletion of &quot;Ralph Juergens&quot; was that he &quot;is only published by vanity presses&quot;; not only is this false, but it fails civility guidelines,[[WP:COI#Importance_of_civility]]. Nevertheless, this was picked up by several other editors as their reasons for supporting the AfD.
:::::::::*But this is not the place to discuss a single article, but I offer this as an example. 
:::::::::*I think it is wholly inappropriate for WP:SCI to advertise articles for deletion. WP:NOTABLE should advertise AfD, giving a editors a chance to refer to WP:SCI and OTHER notability guidelines. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 10:46, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

==One researcher POV fails NPOV==
*The third paragraph includes an incorrect statement:
:&quot;the point of view of one researcher or research term and, unless it generates a significant outside response by the scientific community or the population at large, fails NPOV&quot;
*This is a complete misunderstanding of [[WP:NPOV|NPOV]]. If we attribute a statement to a single researcher, and it conforms to [[WP:A]] and is not misrepresented, then it conforms to NPOV. The argument is whether a statement by a single researchers is ''notable'', which is completely different. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 19:26, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

::*If another attributable view is available, we describe it. If it isn't, we don't pretend there might be one. There is no double whammy.
::*Describing the POV of one person does not automatically fail NPOV, and any decent editor can describe any POV in way that fulfils NPOV.
::*Quashing a POV on the grounds that there MIGHT be a hypothetical counter-POV, fails NPOV, fails WP:A, and fails WP:V. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 00:08, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

:::::*The only requirement to provide a balanced view, is if one exists. If it doesn't, then to pretend that a view &quot;needs balancing&quot;, is presumably based on the view of an unattributable, anonymous, expert-less editor. This fails numerous Wikipedia policies.

:::::*Yet both POVs are EQUALLY valid, as long as they are not misrepresented, and can easily be described in a manner that conforms to NPOV. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 13:15, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

:::::::What you fail to realize is that there is an informal community discussion as well as a formal publication discussion. Those who are in a particular community are aware of the informal discussion and are able to tell when a topic is ignored/scoffed or when it is accepted. This cannot be reported at Wikipedia for verifiability reasons, but it still raises NPOV concerns when certain editors try to force obscure research into the forefront of an article. You are mistaking a standard of verifiability (which is the standard for how to write an article) with editorial judgement: they need not be one-in-the-same. In other words, one need not &quot;verify&quot; that there is NPOV issues because, as editors, our editorial opinions do not need to be (nor can they be) verified. The only thing that needs to be verifiable is the text of the article. We are allowed to have judgements that are external to this. As such, it is perfectly reasonable to say that there are NPOV problems with someone citing a single, isolated, though published research paper. In terms of your dark matter red herring, you have totally misconstrued the situation, and I'm fairly confident that nearly any third party not firmly ensconced in pathological skepticism toward mainstream astrophysics would find your evaluation predictably myopic. Clowe's triumphalist attitude is only justified from the standpoint of [[standing on the shoulders of giants]]. It's not like he was publishing his &quot;proof&quot; of dark matter in a vacuum -- it was a particular point that was addressed to a particular (MOND-type) objection. However, when your hypothetical John Doe bucks the established research by publishing proof against dark matter, he is publishing in a vacuum. Prof. John Doe's work is marginal and therefore marginalized by Wikipedia. Clowe's work is mainstream and therefore reported by Wikipedia. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 14:47, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
::::::::SA is quite right about verifiability vs. editorial judgement.  However, I have to say I worry when editorial judgement of this type comes into dispute.  Wikipedia needs sources for two reasons: one is to have attributions in the articles, but another reason is that it levels the playing field in editorial discussions.  Inherently, experts on Wikipedia are not set above ordinary editors, but they may be more familiar with the subject in question.  But experts have to prove themselves, just like anyone else.  Fundamentally, Wikipedia is a community of equal editors.  So, this is a good argument ''for'' [[WP:SCIENCE]]: in order to avoid having to rely on editorial judgement too heavily, we look for a higher standard of quality in sources for scientific topics, and where that doesn't exist, we should avoid covering the subject.

:::::::::*Let's not mix up NPOV and editorial judgment. As I said earlier, the statement in the introduction is incorrect concerning NPOV. I also said it may concern notability, so I'm not dismissing the point. But let's be accurate as editors.
:::::::::*The idea that a community has informal discussions which a particular editor may be aware, is worthless. It is not verifiable, nor attributable. 
:::::::::*I know THREE different communities, all of whom have informal discussions, and promise peer reviewed papers that I could mention too. Also worthless.
:::::::::*An encyclopedia does not run on material gleaned from Chinese whispers via anonymous, unaccountable editors.
:::::::::*I had previously brought this up at the Neutrality Project, see &quot;[[Wikipedia_talk:Neutrality_Project#NPOV_misunderstanding|NPOV misunderstanding]]&quot;. They agree. A singular POV can be described in an NPOV manner. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 16:01, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

NPOV is inherently based in editorial judgement. The only way that someone determines whether there is a problem with NPOV is by making an editorial judgement. That's why the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{POV}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag comes with the wording it does. Disputes arise between editors over NPOV: if there was a singular editor there would never be NPOV issues from the standpoint of writing an article. While I agree with Mangojuice that editors are judged external to their status as &quot;experts&quot; (see ongoing conflicts over [[WP:EXPERT]] for example), the community doesn't deny the existence of experts either. No one is saying that the encyclopedia should be &quot;run&quot; on expert judgement or the whispers of whatever anonymous and unaccountable ethnic group, but people are saying that editors may come to the table with these concerns. That's the essence of the NPOV guideline: all the points-of-view are placed on the table and the marginalization happens per the outside community and references to the outside world. No one is saying that a singular POV cannot be described, but people are saying that singular POVs present unique difficulties when writing an encyclopedia that is supposed to be NPOV. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 17:39, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

:*Indeed, all the POVs are placed on the table. And if there is just one POV (because there is one WP:V/WP:RS/WP:A), then we can still write that POV so that it conforms to NPOV, regardless of whether you or I or anyone else agrees with the POV, and regardless of whether it is mainstream of pseudoscience.
:*In which case, the statement in the third paragraph that I described above, is incorrect. A view from a single researcher may fail a criteria, but there is no reason for it to fail NPOV; and if it does, any decent editor can re-write it so that it conforms to NPOV. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 19:19, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
:::If there is only one notable POV, then sure, we write about it. In which case the statement in the third paragraph is correct. A view from a single research written about on Wikipedia does have editorial issues related to NPOV for the reasons delineated because the alternatives may exist but cannot be included without falling into original research. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 19:23, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
::::*The statement is incorrect because a single POV does not fail NPOV unless it is written badly, in which case any competent editor can correct it. Sure, the statement may be allowed because it is notable. But it won't fail because of NPOV.
::::*A single POV that has been published elsewhere does not not fail &quot;Original research&quot;, because [[WP:NOR]] &quot;refers to '''unpublished''' facts&quot;. (my emphasis) --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 19:51, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

You are missing the point. Perhaps I should post here the statement that you dispute:

:''Research published in a reputable publication passes these thresholds but reflects the point of view of one researcher or research term and, unless it generates a significant outside response by the scientific community or the population at large, focusing on such research in a Wikipedia article does not adequately conform to [[WP:NPOV|Wikipedia's policy on neutrality]], in particular the section on [[WP:NPOV#Undue weight|undue weight]].''

You'll note that the point being made is that simply quoting published work is not good enough. Why isn't it good enough? Because unless the work in question has generated discussion it has not been vetted outside of Wikipedia to make it possible to write an article on the subject that adheres to the spirit and letter of NPOV.
--[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 20:36, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
::The POV of a single researcher in a single first-rate peer-reviewed publication, has normally been assessed by 2 or usually 3 independent scientists with a tendency to be ciritical. The assumption made by colleagues it that such results are correct unless proven otherwise. Are we supposed to be more critical of physics that he physicists who review for PRL? Then, if discussed by independent sources, as most scientific papers are, it is considered worth citing and commenting one. Reputable journals expect items listed as references to be relevant to the new work also. I'm a librarian. i think many articles in most library journals are basically trivial if not junk altogether.. But they are considered valuable by my colleagues in general, and its their trms that matter. I will judge by reporting theirs',  not imposing my own.'''[[User:DGG|DGG]]''' 09:02, 9 April 2007 (UTC)

:The statement which I quoted above, is as follows:
::&quot;the point of view of one researcher or research term and, unless it generates a significant outside response by the scientific community or the population at large, fails NPOV&quot;
:A single POV may fail, or being accepted by some other criteria. But a single POV does not fail NPOV (unless an editor writes poorly). 
:*To suggest that a statement based on a single POV, changes it's NPOV standing, depending on some other ''potential'' discussion whose view is yet to be determined, is illogical. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 20:46, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

If your point is that someone can attribute a single point of view in a fashion that is NPOV, that is absolutely correct. However, not every attributable point can be written about in a neutral fashion. An example of a quote that may be non-neutral though properly attributed and sourced is given at [[WP:FRINGE#Sourcing and attribution]]. --[[User:ScienceApologist|ScienceApologist]] 00:01, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

:*Since describing a single POV can be achieved in an NPOV fashion, then the description in the third paragraph is incorrect which says that a single POV without response fails NPOV.
:*Judging/assessing a single POV is another matter altogether. But just because there may be no attributable assessments, does not make the description of a single POV automatically fail NPOV. --[[User:Iantresman|Iantresman]] 00:34, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

I do not agree with the demand that not only must something be said in a respected peer reviewed journal, but that we must wait for other independent researchers to chime in, in OTHER respected peer reviewed journals, and agree with the first researcher that the claim is valid. The first post would constitute a reliable source satisfying [[WP:ATT]] and would be usable in a Wikipedia article. Similarly a book from a respected publisher would constitute a reliable source, without waiting for some other authority to write another book that says &quot;I agree with the first book.&quot; The demand places the bar way too high. It may be years before someone completely independent of the first researcher publishes the demanded blessing of the first researcher's claim. [[User:Edison|Edison]] 20:20, 9 April 2007 (UTC)

==[[Schmidt Sting Pain Index]]==
Can some of you knowledgable and discerning scientist Wikipedians take a look at this please? This article has currently been getting some coverage in popular &quot;gee whiz funny link of the day... how goofy!&quot; type blogs ( I hate it when this happens and the article in question is dubious... I think it gives a bad impression of wikipedia), but it seems to be mainly based on the idea that this one insect scientist guy wrote some goofy comments for an insect sting pain index one day. Ok, I agree that insect scientists are allowed to have senses of humour (WITHIN LIMITS, for the sake of us all), but I am concerned that 1) this scale is not really widespread and may be just one scale promoted by one guy without much acceptance in the insect expert community. 2) the pdf article linked which this wikipedia entry seems to be based on does not seem to say that Schmidt actually wrote those goofy comments. Its a bit ambiguous, but its seems to say that &quot;the media&quot; (without specifying what media) came up with the goofy comments to append to Schmidt's original dry scale(I think this may be another case where people exaggerate or misinterpret what an article is saying). I dont have any access to science journal databases, and am certainly no science or insect expert. But these concerns and quick scans of google books and google scholar led me to bring this issue to wiser heads. Thanks very much  for checking this out.

The index also has been mentioned in popular science pubs; though it doesn't appear to be taken seriously by scientists.  A scientifically-based pain index would be interesting (though I decline any offers to participate in such research); both this and the related Starr index appear to be little more than the opinions of the bug guys in question.  The article certainly dances on the edge of notability.  --[[User:EngineerScotty|EngineerScotty]] 05:30, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

******Ok, once again, in case anyone can actually respond on my point: the list of criteria here seems to be a misguided attempt to define reasons for notability that no one brings up in debates.  If the issue was the over-''deletion'' of science articles, having these criteria would make sense.  But it seems to me that the main thrust of this proposal is in the opposite direction.  These are just fodder for disagreement (see [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sorce theory]] for instance) and distract from the main point about the POV and OR issues involved in using only sources from a single author.

********Good: a direct response.  Two brief points: (1) Arbcom never asked for criteria, but they did encourage developing a guideline, which is different.  (2) The EU deletion debate looks very different to me - there, the argument was done from first principles and it worked very nicely, and it skirted around the edge of these criteria (no one ever talked about whether the EU concept was &quot;textbook science&quot; or had institutional support)... and as for extended discussions with Iantresman... I don't think the criteria will make one bit of difference, and that's not a very good reason anyway.  Long-winded debate... I don't think we should seek to avoid it as a general principle, debate is a good thing.  Criteria would simplify the job but scientific topics aren't exactly overwhelming the AfD lists.

== General notability guideline template ==
Since the general notability guideline is central to most sub-pages, someone came up with the idea of creating a centralized template which will be consistent among the permutations from WP:N.  Please see whether we can make this work here.  The text is meant to be fairly generic, but it may make sense to add text following the template for fine tuning, or help us to make the template more applicable if it is not reflecting the consensus for notability.  I certainly didn't get everything that I wanted, but I'm very happy to see the compromises that make this a fairly representive of the attitude of the project.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 01:12, 7 April 2007 (UTC)

==Merging [[Wikipedia:Notability (numbers)]]==
What are the thoughts on merging [[Wikipedia:Notability (numbers)]] into this guideline proposal?  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 19:15, 25 April 2007 (UTC)

I've added a brief section which is the meat from the numbers guideline.  This seems appropriately and neatly combined here.  --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 16:29, 15 May 2007 (UTC)
*It's a bad idea, as explained on the talk page of WP:NUM.

== Scope creep ==

I may be beating a dead horse here, but all the references to NPOV, proponents and advocacy make it seem like this is about pseudoscience/fringe science, and the discussion above seems to confirm it. As it tries to apply to specialised but uncontroversial science, not much of it bears any resemblance to reality. --[[User:Abu-Fool Danyal ibn Amir al-Makhiri|Abu-Fool Danyal ibn Amir al-Makhiri]] 02:29, 6 June 2007 (UTC)

== Proposal concerns (LV) ==
Note that I came here from a couple of AfDs which were trying to present this as policy criteria for an article's deleltion.  As I read down the line, I encountered several problems with the proposed guideline.  I apologize if any and all of the below have been covered in the Talk Archives, which I am not going to read now.

Problems that I have at present with the proposal:

*Introduction:
:* &quot;A topic that is acceptable under this guideline is an appropriate part of Wikipedia.&quot;
::Pretty sweeping blanket statement, to me.  No other Notability criteria I'm aware of suggests that &quot;if it passes this, it's in.&quot;  Indeed, it seems to violate the principle of a Guideline to me, which always limits itself to allow potential exceptions.  Further, each section usually defines which criteria are primary and which are secondary.
*Notability of topics related to science:
:*&quot;Decisions about including or excluding material must always reflect the opinions of outside authorities, not those of Wikipedia editors.&quot;
::I know this has been mentioned above, but I want to echo this concern:  Decisions about including or excluding material must always reflect the consensus of the Wikipedia editors.  Anything else beyond that is helpful clarification, or it becomes fodder for people to [[WP:IAR]].
::I'd feel much more comfortable with something like, ''&quot;Deicions about including or excluding material on a scientific basis ought to be supported by the opinions and stated facts of outside authorities, as per [[WP:RS|Wikpedia:Reliable Sources]].&quot;''  Start throwing 'musts' around in anything but policy (perhaps only unbreakable/unmodifiable policy) and you'll get a lot of irate editors, scientific or not.
:*&quot;Although publication creates verifiability and reputable journals are reliable sources, publication by itself is not a sufficient (and sometimes not necessary) standard for encyclopedic notability. Unpublished research fails no original research and often lacks verifiability, so it is unacceptable by policy. Research published in a reputable publication passes these thresholds but reflects the point of view of one researcher or research term and, unless it generates a significant outside response by the scientific community or the population at large, focusing on such research in a Wikipedia article does not adequately conform to Wikipedia's policy on neutrality, in particular the section on undue weight. This guideline clarifies how the Wikipedia community has applied NPOV to articles on scientific topics. It does however not apply to the inclusion of scientific research as authorative sources within articles. The criterion for such sources is not that they are notable, but that they are reliable.&quot;
::Wha?  Could this be any more complex?  I actually had to diagram this paragraph out to understand it.  My hypothesis is most editors will not.  Can't you simply say it is normally necessary to follow the general notability guidelines with respect to neutral, multiple, independent, verifiabile, reliable sources?  And if you do that, what is the point of this whole section - I'm seriously not understanding how this adds anything to present guidelines.
* Criteria / General
:*&quot;1. Widely cited. Papers covering the topic have been widely1 commented on in academic writing within the topic's field.
::2. Outside notability. The topic is notable due to significant coverage in reliable sources outside of academic publications.&quot;  
::So we want articles only commented upon widely by multiple academic sources, which also are commented on outside academic sources?  Seems pretty wide, to me.
::Aside from that, I know I read somewhere that Wikipedia is not just a general encyclopedia, but can cover articles appropriate to special subject encyclopedias as well.  Thus 2. might well fail, as most specialist encyclopedias I am aware of have many articles which would only be known inside the discipline the encyclopedia represents.
:*&quot;Notable topics which are primarily non-scientific... [etc.]&quot;
::Boy, I'm going to love the AfDs which try to define whether a topic is &quot;science&quot; or not trying to use this.  Not to mention the arguments you'll get whether or not cosmology (for example) has a scientific basis or not.  Not to mention you're setting up a criteria which is so subjective it will rarely-if-ever be able to objectively define where this guideline would be relevant or not.
::Also, you will get editors asking whether the guideline itself applies or not - something I don't think I've ever seen with any of the other specialty N's about the guideline ''itself''.  I don't need to know if Burpa-Cola has been covered in the Cola News and CNN, or if Billy Bob Arthbutnott has both parlimentary opinions as well as the Sun documenting his career to know that Corp or People:Politicians applies.
*Scientific terms
:Again, how does this get beyond neologisms in a way that Avoid Neologisms doesn't, aside from adding the words &quot;scientific literature&quot;?
*Numbers and Sources
:*&quot;1. Have professional mathematicians published papers on this topic?
::2. Is the sequence listed in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences? (In the case of sequences of rational numbers, does the OEIS have the sequences of numerators and denominators of the relevant fractions?)
::3. Do MathWorld and PlanetMath have articles on this topic?&quot;
:::This may be taken from WProj numbers, I don't know.  But are you stipulating that 2 and 3 are reliable sources? (The Sources section has exactly this same problem.  You're controlling what is considered a Reliable Source without allowing the Wikipedia community at large to define that.  I have a problem with that - if I were arguing Notability(Religion), I would not want it to say that the Bible is an authorized source and any other 'holy' texts by default would have to prove themselves.)
*Sources
:*&quot;Scientific discovery is often disconnected from public discourse, so standard methods of sourcing and verifying are not always applicable. A scientific topic which yields low hit counts in the Google test...&quot;
::That's nice.  The Google test is widely regarded as discredited anyway.  Yes, I know it's still used, but it's questionability is known.
::Also, verifying and sourcing is verfying and sourcing.  I believe what's being aimed at here is scientific notability may have a smaller and different base (with different types of sourcing) for inclusion than other forms of notability.  So why not say that?  Except that above you're demanding 'popular' coverage as well as academic.
:*&quot;Web (and library) searches should therefore be evaluated based on the quality rather than the quantity of the finds.&quot;
::Thus, you allow extreme subjectivity creep, unless you are going to make further instruction creep in what constitutes scientific quality.  (My Jung is better than your Freud.  My Hawking beats your Einstein.  My t test is better than your bean counting.)  Common sense might be able to dictate that, but science is full of periods of flying in the face of qualitative common sense and succeeding - because it's right.
:*&quot;The following is a list of sources with qualifications of their usefulness.&quot;
::Again, you're preaching what is and isn't acceptable as a source, without allowing the community consensus to decide this over time. 
:*&quot;Google, Yahoo.... [etc]&quot; 
::Uh, again, how is this any different from Google test?

Finally, may I invite you to consider that most notability guidelines are much less complex and much more tolerant of letting individual cases be decided as individual cases?  And I hope that the question about &quot;Have we reached consensus?&quot; is asking if you as the editors have reached consensus about what you want to present to the community as a whole, as opposed to &quot;Are we ready to make this policy ourselves?&quot;

It may seem like I'm pissing all over your proposal.  I hope it doesn't, because I'd like to see a Notability(Science) guideline.  But I want it to be one that's usable and used - I wouldn't do either with this, and I'd argue as need be when someone tries to use this as a vote justification (which will happen, whether you want it to or not.)  Sorry for the length of the diatribe.

The rejected tag is appropriate and should stand until there is adequate discussion here to demonstrate active interest in the proposal.

It looks like a number of the contributors here are no longer active at WP: Lantreman ws banned, BDJ and Science Appologist have quit, Minder Binder, Abu-Fool Danyal ibn Amir al-Makhiri, and Laughing Vulcan have not contributed substantially since June and at all since mid-July.   &lt;s&gt;Trials and Errors and Radiant are advocating reinstating this as a proposal&lt;/s&gt;, but I don't think that there are enough editors who see this as a need.

* What I see now is something that is so watered down and nebulous that it cannot act as a genuine policy.  If people want to revive this effort, then we need to return to a version like [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Notability_%28science%29&amp;oldid=117329647 this one] and work from there.  IMO, what happenned to this effort is that a number of people whose pet articles were running afoul of this proposed policy chose to get involved with the blatant intent to sabotage it and remove its impact on their work, and unfortunately succeeded in doing so.&lt;br&gt;IMO, there is a genuine need for a policy like this to clarify what &quot;notability&quot; and &quot;verifiability&quot; mean in the context of a science article, and how [[WP:UNDUE]] should be applied.  It may be that this is an issue that is best handled by the admins with the advice and consent of the community so that we can avoid the pitfalls of the past. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:49, 20 August 2007 (UTC)
*I see, if not frequent, so at least [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere/Wikipedia:Notability_%28science%29&amp;limit=500&amp;from=0 recurrent use] of this guideline/proposed guideline/essay, very much in keeping with the rather low number of science-related AfD discussions. Absence of discussion on the talk page certainly doesn't establish rejection. I agree with EMS that the two-item version is watered down beyond recognition of the original version, and I don't see any consensus for it. ~ [[User:Trialsanderrors|trialsanderrors]] 16:07, 20 August 2007 (UTC)
:: Per [[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines]]: ''&quot;A rejected page is any proposal for which consensus support is not present, regardless of whether there is active discussion or not. Consensus need not be fully opposed; if consensus is neutral on the issue and unlikely to improve, the proposal is likewise rejected. It is considered bad form to hide this fact, e.g. by removing the tag. Making small changes will not change this fact, nor will repetitive arguments. Generally it is wiser to rewrite a rejected proposal from scratch and start in a different direction.&quot;'' --[[User:Kevin Murray|Kevin Murray]] 16:14, 20 August 2007 (UTC)

::: It seems to me that a lot of work has gone into turning this into something that everyone can reject.

== Reverted to earlier version ==

I have reverted the article to the form of lat March, with some twaking of the lead and the first section.  The revised first section now has a simple first paragraph that states the need to this policy as succinctly as I can.  The next two paragraphs have had their order exchanged so that the farily dry &quot;relevance&quot; paragraph comes last.  The previous last paragraph has been removed as an unreadable mess.  (I believe I drafted that paragraph originally, but it really never worked as intended, and only got worse over time.)

The {{tl|rejected}} tag has been kept as a matter of form, with the {{tl|proposed}} tag just commented out but still present.  I for one would be happy to see this version go back to &quot;proposed&quot; status, but I want to see if others are on-board for doing that.  Let's just say that after having taken a rest, I am ready and willing to work towards acceptance of a functional version of this as a policy or guideline if others are. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 18:24, 20 August 2007 (UTC)

:Personally, I don't see a lot of point reviving this.  The criteria have always been an attempt to change practice rather than an attempt to document practice, and to most people, the criteria and the proposal are one and the same.  The criteria really haven't caught on, and from my experience, people rely on other policies for scientific topics, like [[WP:OR]] and [[WP:V]], and where notability is needed, the general [[WP:N]] seems to be sufficient and its use is accepted.

:: Having looked more closely at the edit history, I find that your attempt to streamline this two two items has met fairly stiff resistance.  Then again, that is little wonder since your proposed consolidation ends up being little more than a restatement of pre-existing policy.  The goal of this proposal is to set up guidelines that go beyond the current policies and which are adapted to the issues which are unique to science.  Wikiepdia has very much outgrown [[WP:NOR|&quot;No original research&quot;]] and the requirement to use [[peer review]]ed [[scientific journal|journals]].  What do you do with a source that is &quot;peer reviewed&quot; but where the peers are fellow followers of a [[fringe science|fringe theory]]?  What do you do about the use of [[Nature (journal)|Nature magazine]], which is highly respected but does not use peer review to help select its articles?  What do you make of a theory published in a respected scientific journals but on which noone has cared to comment except the author?  What do you do with the [[cold fusion]] controversy created by Pons and Fleishman back in 1987 which obviously is notable within science but which was never respected by it?  There will not be many of these to contend with, but when they do appear this guideline will be invaluable.
:::::Please excuse my comment here, but the article content of Nature is peer reviewed. Like some other journals, it has on rare occasions published things based on consensus of the key editors, without formal peer review. The news content is not, of course, just editorially prepared -- by the most careful people around. It was they who caught the similarity of the stem cell photos after the peer reviewers missed it.

:: You like to cite [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sorce theory]] as a place where this guideline did not work.  For that I solidly disagree.  That article's creator had to play all kinds of games with these criteria to make a case for keeping the article.  In the end, his attempts to make the article look acceptable only helped to do it in.  In context this is a farly powerful tool.  In addition, it is not going to do in fringe science articles.  For example, I helped by have an aritcle on a book by [[Halton Arp]] kept because it was noted within the field of astronomy and also gained some measure of attention from the public at large.  That press coverage (both scientific and popular) could establish notability as described here was helpful in that discussion. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 01:03, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

:::You might note that my reduction to two criteria stood for over two months without comment.  You may also note that coverage by press and by scientific sources were the criteria I left in place, since those are the only part of the criteria that are useful.  What I object to are the other criteria, like &quot;textbook science&quot; or &quot;popular belief&quot; that are redundant and provide loopholes for argumentative POV pushers.  Can you hypothesize an example where a topic is &quot;textbook science&quot; or has a &quot;prominent advocate&quot; or has &quot;institutional support&quot; where the topic would be acceptable for Wikipedia ''without'' significant coverage in independent, reliable sources, academic or otherwise?

::::I am not sure whether I agree with you or not. I certainly think that there are science articles that are best referenced by standard textbooks, particularly for articles that are at the level of high school or early university science. For example, we probably do not want to source a peer reviewed journal on [[density]] and we do not. Are textbooks reliable sources? If so we do not need to mention &quot;textbook science&quot;, but if they are not, we probable do. --[[User:Bduke|Bduke]] 03:09, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

::::::: As for the other criteria: you agree on 3 and 4.  6 is totally pointless, because none of the criteria would expire once met.  7 obviously must require sourcing to back it up or it's totally vacuous and anyone could claim it about anything.  And anything discussed in a legitimate textbook is already covered in a reliable source, and I highly doubt that we'd ever find a case where one textbook mentions a topic but absolutely no other sources do.  Yeah, I agree, if we pare it any further, the ''criteria'' say nothing more than [[WP:N]] does.. so maybe we should lose the criteria altogether, or just spend more time explaining the issues that arise in assessing the quality of sources, especially academic ones.

(unindent) I think that you have just made an excellent suggestions in calling for an explanation of how to assess the reliability and relevance of sources.  Given some of the issues I have had recently with the anti-relativists over at [[talk:Herbert Dingle]], this makes a lot of sense.  (In those discussions, at least one person would take anything that he could find from a &quot;peer reviewed journal&quot; as evidence of a conflict over relativity and the [[twin paradox]].  Said contributions come from almost unknown overseas journals and in another case a blatantly anti-relativity publisher.)  I would still keep the remaining criteria as a way of saying that those things are the primary hallmarks of scientific notability, while noting that other options for notability are not prohibited. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 15:20, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

:I believe that's better, but I still think we should remove the criteria.  The problem is, people always seem to conflate a notability guideline and its criteria, while all other text is ignored.  By not having criteria, we would force people to read the discussion about the reliability of scientific sources.  (Actually, come to think about it, &quot;Notability (science)&quot; may not be the best name.  What about &quot;Reliable sources (scientific)&quot;?)

:: The criteria don't exist for the benefit of those that would abuse them but instead for the benefit of those that are looking for good guidance on what is acceptable.  The creator of an article will invariably try to defend it against an AfD.  IMO, if the article's creator can make a case that their article is acceptable under this criteria and everyone agrees, then these criteria have done a service in helping people to make that decision.  Similarly, if people listen to the creator's case and conclude that it does not hold water, then the criteria will also have helped by focussing the debate on the relevant issues and helping to bring about the deletion.  So as I see it these criteria overall are helpful.  Besides, it really is in the absense of clear guidelines that you get the nastiest debates. --[[User:ems57fcva|EMS]] | [[User_talk:ems57fcva|Talk]] 19:01, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

(a) Notability, (b) reliability of a source, and (b) reliable of the facts in that source, are all quite different, and tell us how to describe information, not whether to include it. If Arp publishes some information in an obscure overseas publications, and Stephen Hawkins in in Nature, Arp's supporters will find his article more notable, and no less reliable. And if Hawkins is described in a textbook, then it tells us that his ideas have a wider readership, and neither are as popular as today's astrology column.  &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment was added by [[Special:Contributions/{{{IP|{{{User|84.244.165.174}}}}}}|{{{IP|{{{User|84.244.165.174}}}}}}]] ([[User talk:{{{IP|{{{User|84.244.165.174}}}}}}|talk]]) {{{Time|17:34, August 21, 2007 (UTC)}}}&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Abandon this as an unnecessary complication==

Whether a peer review journal, a textbook, a popular book, a university hosted website or a notable persons personal site  is sufficiently reliable, reputable, or secondary is probably best treated on a case by case basis, and in any case this is not a problem specific to science.

Are there any controversial articles that are better treated by Notability (science) than by WP:NOR, WPV, and WP:N?  I think not.  I think there are too many guidelines, especially where they overlap.  True science should only need to satisfy WP:NOR and WP:V.  Where the subject is not true science, or is borderline, a further test should be simply whether others have written about it.  WP:N provides this test.  A lot of work has been invested in this project page, but that is not sufficient reason to adopt it.  It is rule creep, and it does damage by obfuscating more important policies and guidelines.

There seems to be tendency here for some to want a guideline to provide a science-quality test.  This is not an encyclopaedia’s role.  The ascribing of “Finge science”, “pseudo science” or “lunacy” to any theory is a job for third party sources, not for wikipedia rules.  

EMS suggests that some nasty debates exist because of the weakness of this guideline.  Some elaboration would be nice.  Discussion above suggests to me that the relativity article needs work, not that wikipedia needs more rules.

This project page should be abandoned.  Science is well covered by WP:OR and WP:V, and where notability is needed, the general WP:N seems to be sufficient and its use is accepted. --[[User:SmokeyJoe|SmokeyJoe]] 02:08, 22 August 2007 (UTC)

It’s always about sourcing, specifically whether the sources are sufficiently independent, sufficiently secondary, sufficiently reputable (not a blog or similar), or covers the subject in sufficient depth.  These are all straight WP:N issues, deriving directly from a combination of WP:NOR and WP:V.  There is plenty of evidence of spirited debate in places about the science of the content involved, and this sometimes is uncivil, but such spirited debate seems to me to be irrelevant to the debates, and always a symptom of editors who are too far into OR editing and are not looking at the subject objectively.  This is why Notability (science) may do more harm than good.  It suggests that there is something special about science.  The criteria for inclusion in wikipedia do not depend upon the science.

==physics? i think not==
do not confuse the observer effect with the uncertainty principle. the uncertainty principle has nothing to do with &quot;observing&quot;, it has to do with measuring. the observer effect is a supposed effect of observing an event and the influence of your presence on the event. no one would ever have to actually observe a particle's position to obfuscate its momentum, the mere act of using the photons to measure its position, even if nobody ever observed it, would suffice.

-------------
don't you have to observe in order to measure?
-------------

Indeed.  But what does measuring have to do with Quantum Mechanics exactly?  

To measure is to observe the results of a measurement process [that ascertains the subject measurement].  Humans observe with their senses — the senses that humans have.  Other conscious beings, perhaps including computers, may have other senses with which they can implement tools for making measurements.  At the end of the day, measuring ''ALWAYS'' involves observing.  

Tools used by beings to make measurements are limited (in their accuracy) by various factors including the limitations of ones senses.  The often-mentioned example of bouncing a photon off of an atom to measure its position illustrates the problem with knowing the position ''AND'' momentum of ''THAT'' atom at the ''SAME MOMENT'' in time.  The concept usually centers on the fact that the position measurement photon will change the momentum of the subject atom.  But aren't there other aspects of this problem?  

In the limit (considering the non-zero mass of the atom and the non-zero energy of the photon), can one ever know perfectly even the position alone?  Perhaps so, since the mechanical inertance of the atom precludes its reaction at ''THAT'' infinitesimal instant in time.  

Why is not ''THIS'' example an instance of &quot;observer effect&quot; rather than the uncertainty principle, per se?  If one seeks only to measure the position alone, then maybe it is neither.  Then again, is it not &quot;Observer Effect&quot; even if the momentum is changed by measuring only the position?  One would think so.  

Well, what if we start with measuring the momentum &quot;first&quot;?  How does one measure momentum, anyway?  Again, we observers devise a measurement process that allows our senses to detect the &quot;answer.&quot;  Momentum is mass times velocity.  If we know the mass, we might then seek to measure the velocity.  Human observers tend to ascertain velocity by measuring position at two points in time.  For non-zero velocities, this means two different points in space, of course.  Yet, [instantaneous] velocity is ''DEFINED'' at only one point in space and time.  Thus, one cannot measure velocity (or momentum) in this manner: one must ''WAIT'' to ''SEE'' how fast it is moving, and this yields only an average (not instantaneous) value.  

Before continuing on to propose measuring momentum, per se, by some other means (say, smashing the atom into an obstacle at a known position), we should note that the Uncertainty Principle pertains only to Quantum Mechanics.  In ''THAT'' world, particles are not particles; rather, they are probability density functions.  The interpretation of this ''MODEL'' of a particle says the position and momentum of the subject particle are INHERENTLY uncertain by virtue of the mathematical model itself.  To precisely derive the position, one must manipulate the model in a manner that causes the momentum &quot;to drop out of the formula,&quot; and vice versa.  

The relationship between position and momentum described by Quantum Mechanics is somewhat like the relationship between the time domain and the frequency domain described by the Fourier Transform.  One can say that there is some similarity as well between position and velocity in Classical Mechanics.  In fact, the description above with knowing the velocity versus position of the atom is exactly that: Classical Mechanics. 

Following this line of thinking, one (''such as this user who is not fluent in the intricate semantics of Quantum Theory'') might be likely to reach these conclusions: 
 

'''1. Using &quot;particulate&quot; atoms and photons to describe the Uncertainty Principle of Quantum Mechanics is ''flat wrong''.''' 

'''2. One does not observe Quantum Mechanics.  Rather, one uses that theory to make calculations to explain the observations of certain experiments.'''

'''3. Measurements ''ALWAYS'' involve observations and therefore also ''ALWAYS'' involve the Observer Effect.  Perhaps this ''IS'' the “Theory of the Observer Effect.”'''

'''4. The Uncertainty Principle of Quantum Mechanics and the Observer Effect are ''fundamentally'' unrelated.'''  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:JimRodgers|JimRodgers]] ([[User talk:JimRodgers|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/JimRodgers|contribs]]) 12:54, 31 July 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

For some reason this article is more focused on what the observer effect is not. --[[User:Nathanael Bar-Aur L.|Nathanael Bar-Aur L.]] 20:09, 10 April 2007 (UTC)

From what I understood from other sources, the observer effect is basically the collapsing of a quantum system's wavefunction that happens the moment a measurement in made upon it (by an &quot;observer&quot;), therefore cancelling any superposition that may have existed beforehand, and giving specific definition to the renderings. Is this correct? --[[User:Nathanael Bar-Aur L.|Nathanael Bar-Aur L.]] 20:21, 10 April 2007 (UTC)

==Suggestions==
Current article states &quot;not that of the driveshaft, along the axis of the car&quot;.
Add a paragraph that illustrates this with the driveshaft of the front-engine, rear-wheel-drive Porsche 928.
Also industrial examples and diagrams from mechanical engineering and classical mechanics.
e.g. a torque tube to allign parts of a hinge operated by two hydraulic cylinders.&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/206.188.57.60|206.188.57.60]] ([[User talk:206.188.57.60|talk]]) 14:42, 30 October 2006 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;

== Diagrams ==
Can anyone find a picture of this? I'm having a very hard time picturing what this would look like...[[User:70.157.134.125|70.157.134.125]] 01:01, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

==Accuracy==
This page is not really accurate. Cars like the STS, Corvette, etc. have independent rear suspensions, and the torque tube is not used to transmit acceleration forces in these vehicles. Rather, it is because they have trans-axles in the rear of the car and it connects the trans-axle with the engine in the front. However, I am not enough of an expert on the subject to write a clear and well-written clarification so I have just added some templates to the top of the page. --[[User:Ozziegt|Ozziegt]] ([[User talk:Ozziegt|talk]]) 21:33, 1 July 2009 (UTC)

:Corvette since at least 1988 doesn't have a torque tube (unless they put one in later), and apart from the Miata I'm hard pushed to think of an IRS that uses one. I agree, this article is pretty horrid, it needs a rewrite rather than refs. [[User:Greglocock|Greglocock]] ([[User talk:Greglocock|talk]]) 11:13, 2 July 2009 (UTC)

:Corvettes since the late 90's do indeed have torque tubes, of the same type that the Porsche 924/944/928 etc use.  All the mentioned Porsches are IRS and use a torque tube.  Part of the probem with this article is that it lumps very diverse systems together;  the early Ford systems are completely different from the Corvette/Porsche systems.  Both are classified as torque tubes, but the article does not focus on the essence of a TT, which is the use of a smaller torque-transmitting element inside a carrier. The carrier may or may not be static and may or may not be carrying driveline forces (like the Fords). [[User:52FordF-1|52FordF-1]] ([[User talk:52FordF-1|talk]]) 15:44, 18 July 2009 (UTC)

::Yup my bad, 2005 Corvette (as a random example) uses a transaxle and a torque tube. Note that the Corvette system is different to the Peugoet one, as the latter includes an articulating joint at the front whereas the Corvette system does not. This is a big deal, to a driveline engineer at least.[[User:Greglocock|Greglocock]] ([[User talk:Greglocock|talk]]) 23:25, 18 July 2009 (UTC)

:Agreed. The article as written is essentially BS. A torque tube fundamentally counteracts the torque of the driveshaft; the alternative is that the torque is counteracted by the torsional rigidity of the frame (the net torque must, obviously, be zero otherwise the rear of the car would rotate). The torque tube often does transfer forward wheel force to the front of the car, but this is not inherent in the mere fact of having a torque tube: there must still be a mechanism locating the wheels longitudinally relative to the diff/transaxle. This is analogous to the usual need to locate the wheels relative to the frame (most simply, with leaf springs) in order to move the car forward.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/110.175.57.184|110.175.57.184]] ([[User talk:110.175.57.184|talk]]) 05:05, 18 March 2011 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== simple definition? ==

It has been my understanding from looking through service manuals and talking to mechanics that the corvette style torque tubes are just an enclosed driveshaft that connects a front mounted engine to the rear mounted transmission (with fully independent rear suspension)

I guess it's not simply called a 'driveshaft' in a classical sense since it doesn't connect a front mounted transmission to the rear differential  &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/184.57.87.173|184.57.87.173]] ([[User talk:184.57.87.173|talk]]) 20:38, 15 August 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</text>

'''''Hello!'''''

Thanks for uploading some pictures to Wikipedia.  I wanted to make sure you were aware of some of the requirements and good practices for uploaded images.

*'''Pick an image name.'''
:When [[Special:Upload|uploading]] an image, pick a file name that is descriptive, and unique.  Remember that many images may be uploaded about the same topic, and remember that names are case sensitive.

*'''Source the image.'''
:On the [[Help:Image page|image description page]], explain where the image came from.  If you created the image yourself, then say so.  If it's from the web, give a URL.  If it's a screenshot of a movie or game, or a scan from a book, give the title.

*'''Provide copyright and license information.'''
:This part is a little bit trickier, but it's very important.  The copyright of the image generally belongs to whomever created it.
::''If it's a photograph you took, or an image you created'' (modifying an image that already exists doesn't count) in software like [[Photoshop]] or [[GIMP]], then you own the copyright.  To upload it to Wikipedia, you must agree to license it under the [[GFDL]] (which allows anyone to use it, but requires that they give credit to the original author and requires that any further edit to the image be licensed under the GFDL as well) or release it into the [[public domain]] (which allows anyone to use it for any purpose without restriction.)  Do this by placing an appropriate [[WP:ICT|tag]] on the [[Wikipedia:image description page|image description page]], like &amp;#123;{[[Template:GFDL|GFDL]]}} or &amp;#123;{[[Template:PD|PD]]}}.  Be sure to mention that you created the image.  If you're using &amp;#123;{[[Template:PD|PD]]}}, you may also want to use &amp;#123;{[[Template:NoRightsReserved|NoRightsReserved]]}}, since there is some dispute as to whether one may grant items into the public domain.
::''If you didn't create the image,'' or the copyright somehow belongs to another party (like a screenshot, which you might &quot;create&quot;, but the copyright belongs to the author of the movie or video game), then you need to find another [[WP:ICT|tag]] that describes the copyright status of the image.  Images used on Wikipedia need to be free for our use and the use of [[WP:FORKS|sites]] which reproduce our content.  This means that images cannot have a restriction such as &quot;only for use by Wikipedia&quot;, or &quot;for non-commercial use only&quot;, or &quot;for educational use&quot;.  Images without a free license may be usable in certain articles under [[WP:FU|fair use]], but such a use should be justified on the image description page.

*'''Describe the image.'''
:To another reader, the image may not be immediately understood.  A caption in an article doesn't explain the image to a visitor who sees it on its image page.  Put a brief explanation of what is in the image on the image description page, similar to what you might include in a caption on an article.  

Some links to Wikipedia pages on this subject: 

'''[[Wikipedia:Copyrights#Image guidelines|Copyrights]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags|Copyright tags]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Fair use|Fair use]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Image description page|Image description page]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Granting work into the public domain|Public domain]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion|Images for deletion]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Possibly unfree images|Possibly unfree images]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Copyright problems|Copyright problems]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Uploading images|Uploading images]]'''

Thanks again for your contributions.  If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me at my talk page. [[User:Feydey|feydey]] 19:42, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

An '''anti-submarine missile'''  is a [[standoff missile|standoff]] [[anti-submarine weapon]]. Often a variant of [[anti-ship missile]] designs an anti-submarine systems typically use a [[jet engine|jet]] or [[rocket engine|rocket]] engine, to deliver: an [[explosive material|explosive]] [[warhead]] aimed directly at a [[submarine]]; a [[depth charge]], or;  a homing [[torpedo]] that is carried from a launch ship, or other  platform, to the vicinity of a target.
[[File:Ikara missile.JPG|thumb|right|&lt;small&gt;[[Ikara (missile)|Ikara]], an [[Australia]]n-designed missile used by several navies between the 1960s and 1990s; a [[rocket engine|rocket]]-parachute delivery system carried an [[acoustic torpedo]] up to 10 nautical miles (19 km) after launch. A variant re-designed in the UK and used by the Royal Navy could deliver a [[Nuclear depth bomb|nuclear depth charge]].&lt;/small&gt;]]
[[File:Maille-Braize-14.jpg|thumb|&lt;small&gt;The [[Malafon]], used by the French Navy between 1966 and 1997, used a rocket-assisted glider to carry a torpedo up to 8 nautical miles (13 km) after launch&lt;/small&gt;. ]]

==History==
[[Depth charge]]s were the earliest weapons designed for use by ships against submerged [[submarine]]s. These explosives were initially dropped as the ship moved over the presumed location of a submarine. Before World War II, shipboard [[sonar]] was unable to maintain contact with a submarine at close range. 

Various [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]]-type projectors, including [[hedgehog (weapon)|hedgehog]] and [[squid (weapon)|squid]], were devised during [[World War II]] to allow a ship to maintain sonar contact while lobbing explosive charges toward the submarine.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Terry, and Costello, John ''The Battle of the Atlantic'' (1977) Dial Press {{Listed Invalid ISBN|0-8037-6454-2}} pp.307-308&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the [[Cold War]], [[missile]]s were developed to provide greater range with reduced [[recoil]]. Some missiles and rockets carry [[homing torpedo]]es to provide terminal guidance for the warhead.&lt;ref&gt;Albrecht, Gerhard ''Weyer's Warships of the World'' (1969) United States Naval Institute p.385&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''northern river shark''' or '''New Guinea river shark''' (''Glyphis garricki'') is a [[species]] of [[requiem shark]], in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Requiem shark|Carcharhinidae]] found in scattered [[tidal river]]s and associated coastal waters in northern [[Australia]] and in [[Papua New Guinea]]. This species inhabits areas with poor visibility, soft bottoms, and large [[tide]]s, with immature sharks ranging into [[freshwater|fresh]] and [[brackish water]]. It is similar to other river sharks in having a stocky grey body with a high back, tiny eyes, and broad fins. It measures up to {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} long.

Northern river sharks are likely [[piscivorous]]. This species is [[viviparous]], with females bearing litters of 9 young possibly every other year before the [[wet season]]. Very rare and facing threats from [[commercial fishing|commercial]] and [[recreational fishing]], and perhaps also [[habitat degradation]], this species has been assessed as [[Critically Endangered]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]].

==Taxonomy==
The first known specimens of the northern river shark, two newborn males from Papua New Guinea, were discovered by [[New Zealand]] [[ichthyologist]] [[Jack Garrick]], after whom the species was eventually  named. This shark was referred to as &quot;''Glyphis'' sp. C&quot; until 2008, when it was formally described by [[Leonard Compagno]], William White, and [[Peter R. Last]] in a [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] paper. The [[type specimen]] is a female {{convert|67|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, collected from the [[East Alligator River]], [[Kakadu National Park]], [[Northern Territory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Compagno, L.J.V. |author2=W.T.

==Distribution and habitat==
The northern river shark has been reported from [[King Sound]], the [[Ord River]], and Doctors Creek near [[Derby, Western Australia]], the [[Adelaide River|Adelaide]] and [[Alligator Rivers]] in Australia's [[Northern Territory]], and the [[Daru]] region and possibly the [[Fly River]] in Papua New Guinea. It inhabits large [[river]]s, [[estuaries]], and coastal [[bay]]s, all of which are characterized by high [[turbidity]], silty or muddy bottoms, and large tides. Young and juvenile sharks are found in fresh, brackish, and salt water ([[salinity]] ranging from 2 to 36 ppt), whereas adults have only been found in marine environments.&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pillans et al&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pillans, R.D. |author2=J.D.

==Description==
Like other members of its genus, the northern river shark has a stocky body with a high back. The head is wide and flattened, with a broadly rounded snout and minute eyes equipped with [[nictitating membrane]]s. Each [[nostril]] is divided into a very large incurrent opening and a small excurrent opening by a triangular skin flap. The sizable mouth is broadly arched, with short furrows at the corners. Thirty-one to 34 tooth rows are in the upper jaw and 30&amp;ndash;35 tooth rows are in the lower jaw; the upper teeth are upright and triangular with serrated edges, while the lower teeth are narrower and straight to slightly curved. In the largest individuals, the first few lower teeth from the jaw median are spear-shaped with serrations near the tip.&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;/&gt;

The [[pectoral fin]]s are large and broad, with gently backward-curving margins and pointed tips. The [[pelvic fin]]s are triangular with nearly straight trailing margins. The first [[dorsal fin]] is long-based and triangular, with the apex almost forming a right angle; the second dorsal fin is some two-thirds as high as the first. The origin of the first dorsal fin lies over the pectoral fin insertions, while that of second dorsal fin lies over the pelvic fin rear tips. No ridge exists between the dorsal fins. The [[anal fin]] is smaller than the second dorsal fin and has a strong notch in the rear margin. The [[caudal fin]] has a strong lower lobe and a long, narrow upper lobe with a ventral notch near the tip. The [[dermal denticle]]s are small, oval, and overlapping, bearing three horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth. This shark is steel-gray above and white below; the color transition is sharp, located well below the eye, and becomes jagged on the sides of the trunk. The anal and caudal fins become dusky or black towards the trailing margins and tips. The maximum known length is {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}}. This species differs from the [[speartooth shark]] (''G. glyphis'') in several [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] and [[meristic]] characters, including having fewer [[vertebra]]e (137&amp;ndash;151 versus 213&amp;ndash;222) and a lower, jagged gray-white color boundary.&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;/&gt;

==Biology and ecology==
With its slender teeth, small eyes, and high density of [[ampullae of Lorenzini]], the northern river shark seems to be [[adaptation|adapted]] for hunting [[fish]] in conditions of poor visibility. In Doctors Creek, sharks may move to and from favored feeding areas with the tide.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thorburn, D.C., D.L. Morgan, A.J. Rowland and H.S. Gill. (February 2004). [http://www.environment.gov.au/coasts/publications/pubs/glyphis-wa.pdf The northern river shark (''Glyphis'' sp. C) in Western Australia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108234623/http://environment.gov.au/coasts/publications/pubs/glyphis-wa.pdf |date=8 November 2011 }}. Report to the National Heritage Trust, Murdoch University. Retrieved on 10 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Like other requiem sharks, this species is [[viviparous]], with the developing [[embryo]]s forming a [[placenta]]l connection to their mother after exhausting their supply of [[yolk]]. Females give birth around October, before the start of the [[wet season]], on possibly a biennial cycle. One female examined contained nine [[fetus]]es.&lt;ref name=&quot;pillans et al&quot;/&gt; The young are born at under {{convert|67|cm|in|abbr=on}} long; males [[sexual maturity|mature]] between lengths of {{convert|1.2|and|1.4|m|ft|abbr=on}}, while females mature between lengths of {{convert|1.4|and|1.7|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;compagno et al&quot;/&gt;

==Human interactions==
The northern river shark appears to be extremely rare, though more subpopulations may remain to be discovered in Australia and Papua New Guinea. Based on present information, no more than 250 mature individuals are estimated to exist in the wild, with no more than 50 in any particular subpopulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt; This species is caught legally and illegally by [[commercial fisheries]] using [[longline fishing|longlines]] and [[gillnet]]s, as well as by [[recreational fishing|recreational fishers]]; [[habitat degradation]] may pose a further threat to its survival. Because of its low natural abundance, limited distribution, stringent habitat requirements, and susceptibility to various human-caused threats, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] has assessed the northern river shark as [[critically endangered]]. It has also been listed as endangered on the 1999 Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, and on the 2000 Territory Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act. Kakadu National Park may be an important protected area for this species.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt; No regulations restrict the capture of this species in Papua New Guinea.&lt;ref name=&quot;white et al&quot;/&gt;

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Zoidberg. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Zoidberg~enwiki that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]]. If you think you might own all of the accounts with this name and this message is in error, please visit [[Special:MergeAccount]] to check and attach all of your accounts to prevent them from being renamed.

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== Hare Krishna picture ==

There is a picture of a Hare Krishna procession in the [[Religion_in_Mexico#Buddhism|Buddhism]] section, even with a caption about them being buddhists. Hare Krishnas are not buddhists, they are hindus. The article is semi-protected so I can not correct that myself. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Wenzelkarbovski|Wenzelkarbovski]] ([[User talk:Wenzelkarbovski|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Wenzelkarbovski|contribs]]) 17:39, 22 April 2015 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Self-ascription fallacy ==

''The last census reported, by self-ascription, that over 95% of the population is Christian.''

The so-called self-ascription of the census is nothing but a silly way of measuring data. Obviously they count children as Christians just because their parents say so. This people should either be clear about this or not count children at all. By the way, since a couple of years ago the Catholic Church has started to indoctrinate [[Huichol]] kids. Shame on us, Mexicans. Shame on us... The Huichols were one of the very few indigenous people whose religious tradition haven't been polluted by Catholicism but now the church has started taking advantage of the poverty of this people and the new constitutional reforms to infiltrate to their villages and improvise &quot;schools&quot;. Of course they know that adults wouldn't let themselves be indoctrinated so they choose to attack young minds. Catholicism and ignorance have been the ingredients of our condition as a Third World country.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Scandza|Scandza]] ([[User talk:Scandza|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Scandza|contribs]]) 13:27, 30 May 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;


Can anyone explain why the Evangelical Free Church of America does so many, many missionary trips to Mexico, when it's a predominantly catholic country? I mean, there are definite ideological differences involved, but I wasn't aware the two churches actively tried to convert each other's members.


==First phrase==

Any interest in removing &quot;Unlike some other Latin American countries&quot; from the first sentence of the article? It does not seem to serve any objective purpose and seems slightly antagonistic.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Namenderkrieg|Namenderkrieg]] ([[User talk:Namenderkrieg|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Namenderkrieg|contribs]]) 15:34, 24 March 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

==Easter==

I'm removing this:

&quot;Some of them however, do not celebrate Easter because they think that the Easter Bunny is the devil. Instead of celebrating Easter, they like to eat Mexican Pizzas.&quot;

because it's obviously untrue and just stupid. I think the article should be rewritten though, by someone more experienced than I am.--[[User:PARCGOP|PARCGOP]] 14:09, 7 April 2007 (UTC)

==Contradiction?==
This article says that 95% of people in Mexico are Roman Catholic.  The Mexico article states that 95% of people are Christian, and only 89% are Roman Catholic.  Which is correct, or am I just confused?
[[User:Yumecosmos|Yumecosmos]] ([[User talk:Yumecosmos|talk]]) 02:20, 9 January 2008 (UTC)

== Rewriting ==

I have imported the Religion section from the article on [[Mexico]] and integrated the information that was only on this article. I also moved around paragraphs and added a subtitle to make reading easier. Finally I removed the stub templates and replaced it with the expand one. --[[User:Marianika|Marianika]] ([[User talk:Marianika|talk]]) 16:32, 19 May 2008 (UTC)

== What about non-believers? ==

What about atheists, agnostics, deists in Mexico? How many Mexicans actually believe in God? Is there any data about that?  &lt;small&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/213.196.243.113|213.196.243.113]] ([[User talk:213.196.243.113|talk]]) 22:41, 27 May 2008 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

== Mexican Ethnic Religion (Mexicayotl) ==

This article lacks a part about the growing movement of Mexicayotl, or Ethnic Mexican Culture or Religion, which is the revival of &quot;Aztec&quot; religion. --[[Special:Contributions/79.45.49.143|79.45.49.143]] ([[User talk:79.45.49.143|talk]]) 12:47, 16 August 2010 (UTC)

== Typo in Nonreligious section ==

'''John Ralph Ragazzini''' (January 3, 1912&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pnxBAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=John+Ralph+Ragazzini+1912&amp;dq=John+Ralph+Ragazzini+1912&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjC4sew9dPVAhXMHJoKHeWmAFsQ6AEIKzAB Profile of John Ralph Ragazzini]&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; November 22, 1988) was an [[United States|American]] [[electrical engineer]] and a professor of [[Electrical Engineering]]. 

==Biography==
Ragazzini was born in [[Manhattan, New York City]] and received the degrees of B.S. and E.E. at the [[City College of New York]] in 1932 and 1933 and earned the degrees of A.M. and Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at [[Columbia University]] in 1939 and 1941.

Ragazzini was dean of the School of Engineering and Science at [[New York University]] and during [[World War II]] he was chairman of the Department of Electrical Engineering at Columbia University, where he was involved in the [[Manhattan Project]].

Ragazzini's notable students are [[Rudolf E. Kálmán]] (see [[Kalman filter]]s), [[Eliahu Ibraham Jury]] (see [[Z-transform]]), [[Gene F. Franklin]] (see [[digital control]]), and [[Lotfi Asker Zadeh]] (see [[Fuzzy sets]] and [[Fuzzy logic]]).

Ragazzini is also credited, along with Lotfi Zadeh, in 1952, to have pioneered the development of the [[z-transform]] method in [[discrete-time]] [[signal processing]] and analysis.

In 1970 he received the [[Rufus Oldenburger Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asme.org/about-asme/honors-awards/achievement-awards/rufus-oldenburger-medal |title=Rufus Oldenburger Medal |publisher=[[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] |accessdate={{Format date|2013|2|14}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, [[American Automatic Control Council]] named [[John R. Ragazzini Award]] after Ragazzini and he was the first recipient of the award. Ragazzini died on 22 November 1988, aged 76.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/24/obituaries/john-ragazzini-76-educator-and-engineer.html&lt;/ref&gt;

I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under [[Wikipedia:Fair use|fair use]] but there is no [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline|explanation or rationale]] as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags/Fair use|boilerplate fair use template]], you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with [[WP:FU|fair use]].

Please go to [[:Image:Brokeninpieces.jpg|the image description page]] and edit it to include a [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline |fair use rationale]]. Using one of the templates at [[Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline]] is an easy way to insure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template. Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.

If there is other other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on the other images used on this page.

The '''United Church, Chapel on the Hill''' in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]] was the city's main church during [[World War II]]. Dedicated on September 30, 1943 and completed late in October 1943, it was originally a multi-denominational [[chapel]] shared by [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and [[Judaism|Jewish]] congregations.&lt;ref name=NationalRegister/&gt;&lt;ref name=churchhistory&gt;[http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=category&amp;sectionid=4&amp;id=39&amp;Itemid=55 Church History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728092956/http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=category&amp;sectionid=4&amp;id=39&amp;Itemid=55 |date=July 28, 2011 }}, United Church, Chapel on the Hill website, accessed March 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architectural design ==
The building design is a [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] 700-series [[U.S. Army]] chapel.&lt;ref name=Townsite&gt;[http://oakridgevisitor.com/history/pdf/OriginalTownSites.pdf Chapel on the Hill] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517124718/http://oakridgevisitor.com/history/pdf/OriginalTownSites.pdf |date=May 17, 2008 }} in ''Jackson Square – the original Townsite'', Oak Ridge Convention and Visitors' Bureau&lt;/ref&gt; It is a frame building built on a three-bay rectangular plan with a [[Steeple (architecture)|steeple]]d [[bell tower]] and a [[gable]] entry [[porch]]. It was one of three Army chapels built using the same design in Oak Ridge during World War II. One of the other two chapels, the West Chapel in the city's West Village area, was later torn down, but the East Chapel in the East Village is still in use.&lt;ref name=NationalRegister&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfo.doe.gov/me70/history/NPSweb/Oak_Ridge_Historic_District_(Preferred).pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form for Oak Ridge Historic District |date=July 18, 1991 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829041710/http://www.cfo.doe.gov/me70/history/NPSweb/Oak_Ridge_Historic_District_%28Preferred%29.pdf |archivedate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The U.S. Army built the chapel to house religious activities, as one of numerous community facilities in the &quot;townsite&quot; area of Oak Ridge. The building was dedicated on September 30, 1943, in a ceremony that included [[prayer]]s and talks by a Jewish [[rabbi]], a [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|Catholic priest]], an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] priest, a [[Baptist]] minister, and the [[minister (Christianity)|minister]] who was serving the United Church congregation that eventually came to own the chapel.&lt;ref&gt;Charles W. Johnson and Charles O. Jackson (1981), ''City Behind a Fence: Oak Ridge, Tennessee, 1942-1946''. The University of Tennessee Press. Pages 127-129.&lt;/ref&gt; Its name, &quot;The Chapel on the Hill,&quot; comes from a reference in a prayer by the Knoxville Baptist minister who participated in the dedication.&lt;ref name=Townsite/&gt;

The United Church congregation that is housed in the Chapel on the Hill traces its history to July 18, 1943, when some 25 to 30 Christians of diverse denominational backgrounds gathered for Sunday worship in Oak Ridge's main [[cafeteria]]. Subsequently, several members of the group made plans to establish an interdenominational Protestant church, led by [[laity|layperson]]s, to include all denominations. A [[Presbyterian]] minister working in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] was engaged to conduct weekly services, and about 150 people representing 13 Protestant denominations became charter members of &quot;the United Church&quot;. Governing boards of laypersons elected to lead the new congregation took up their duties on October 24, 1943.&lt;ref name=pre1980&gt;[http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=51&amp;Itemid=55 Pre-1980 Historical Compilation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728093006/http://thechapelonthehill.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=51&amp;Itemid=55 |date=July 28, 2011 }}, United Church, Chapel on the Hill website, accessed March 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Chapel-on-the-Hill was completed that same month, the United Church and the local Roman Catholic Church were given control of the building, as the only two churches then officially operating in the [[Manhattan Project]] community. During the war, when Oak Ridge's Manhattan Project facilities were operating around the clock, the chapel building was also in use nearly 24 hours a day as a venue for worship services, [[wedding]]s, and other occasions for local workers of various Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish religious backgrounds.&lt;ref name=pre1980/&gt;

At the peak of wartime activity in Oak Ridge, when the population exceeded 70,000, the United Church employed four ministers and conducted worship services in the Chapel on the Hill, East Village Chapel, and the Jefferson Theater, as well as [[Sunday school]] classes in several local schools and a [[mobile home|trailer]] camp. By 1951, the United Church Chapel-on-the-Hill consolidated as a single [[interdenominational]] congregation, making its home in the Chapel on the Hill building.&lt;ref name=pre1980/&gt;

The United Church congregation purchased the chapel and {{convert|3.72|acre|ha}} of land from the [[U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]] on May 11, 1955 for a price of $17,116.&lt;ref name=pre1980/&gt; An adjoining educational building was added in 1956-1957.
